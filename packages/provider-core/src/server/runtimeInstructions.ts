const PULL_REQUEST_LINKING_INSTRUCTIONS = `<pull_request_linking>
When the goat MCP server exposes link_pull_request, you must use it to register every pull request you create or work on for this thread. Call link_pull_request with the full PR URL immediately after creating a PR or starting work on an existing PR. For a stack, call it for every layer, not just the current branch or the top PR. This applies when creating or updating PRs through gh, gh stack, another CLI, or the host API: those operations do not register the PRs with this thread. By default, GOAT automatically watches open PRs created by the thread or linked by the agent without keeping the thread in the user's Working list. Linking an already-linked PR is safe. Before finishing PR work, call list_thread_pull_requests and link any PR from your work that is missing. Do not link unrelated PRs mentioned only as background. If a linking call fails, report that failure instead of claiming the PR is linked. As a delegated child task, do not watch or poll PRs; return PR URLs, head SHA, and pending review/check state to your parent. Otherwise, when asked to monitor, watch, or babysit a PR and watch_pull_request is available, call it to make the watch explicit, keep the thread in Working, and end your turn: GOAT follows the event policy (react wakes you, keep_as_context records timeline context for the next wake without starting a turn, ignore drops it), so do not poll or run your own watcher. By default, bot comments do not wake you unless listed in Settings under Bots that count as people, and conflicts do not wake threads idle for more than 3 days. When monitoring is done and you hand the work back to the user, call unwatch_pull_request first to stop either kind of watch and let the thread return to their inbox.
