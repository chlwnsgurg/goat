# 000 — GOAT SSH runtime supply (root fix)

Dispatch to an SSH host needs the remote to run this app's GOAT runtime, but the app had no dependable way to supply it, and the desktop replaced the remote runner before the new runtime existed, so a nightly update took the MacBook Pro server down. This unit makes the switch safe (install, verify, then switch), makes the app carry its own runtime archives, separates GOAT's identity and update feed from upstream T3, and lets protocol-compatible runtimes be reused across nightly numbers. Then it replaces the user's app with the new build, verifies a real dispatch, and pushes.

Branch goat/ssh-runtime-supply (origin/dev 1ea5118af + 7 carried commits) in /Users/jun/Developer/new/700_projects/t3code-lanes/goat-release-rename. Research: 001_research.md (four gpt-6.1-sol leaves).

## Loop spec
- Archetype: satisfy-spec, multi-cycle, user order 2 → 1 → 4 → 3, then stabilize/replace/push.
- Trigger: user request (2026-10-11) "2 1 4 3 다 cxc-loop 돌아서 … 안정화해놓고 앱 교체해놓고 푸시해".
- Non-goals: GitHub release publishing, public bucket, PRs, main merge, notarization, migrating upstream installs, killing processes we did not start (except user-authorized), touching upstream ~/.t3 on hosts.
- Verifier: per cycle focused vp test runs from owning package dirs + targeted tsc + rg gates + independent gpt-6.1-sol review PASS; wp5 live evidence + goat-ci green on EPYC.
- Stop: all criteria met or a blocker (mac-studio offline → NEEDS_HUMAN for its app replacement only).
- Memory: this unit; goalplan goat-ssh-runtime-supply-root-fix-hotl-cxc-loop-r.
- Escalation: local data-home choice (D9, asked), anything needing Apple notarization/provisioning secrets.
- Resources: local shell, gh (lidge-jun), ssh juns-macbook-pro (= this Mac), Node 24 + Node 26 (SEA), cargo, gpt-6.1-sol subagents unlimited. Push authorized by user.

## Decisions
| ID | Decision |
|---|---|
| D1 (item 2) | Verify the candidate runner (RUNNER_NEXT --version, which installs/validates the runtime) before it replaces run-t3.sh; every stop/restart stays after that boundary; failure leaves runner bytes, ownership files, runtime and process intact with an actionable error. Pairing and MCP prefer an existing runner; cold hosts stage→verify→publish. Stale-tunnel recovery closes only the local forward (remove from map before closing scope) so reconnects never stop the remote server. |
| D2 (item 1) | RemoteT3RunnerOptions gains bundledArchiveDirectory (read-only). Acquisition: remote ready/retained-ready → bundled archive → user cache archive → local gh into cache → upload. Desktop passes <resourcesPath>/ssh-runtime/archives when packaged and exports T3CODE_SSH_BUNDLED_RUNTIME_ARCHIVE_DIR to its backend so server dispatch uses the same bundle. build-desktop-artifact gains --ssh-runtime-archive-dir (stage archives + canonical sidecars to extraResources; release requires darwin-arm64/linux-x64/linux-arm64, local builds accept the host archive only). release-desktop.yml produces CLI archives before desktop packaging (not exercisable here: release workflows are disabled; validated by tests only). Dev: vp run dev:runtime-archive builds the host archive into <home>/runtime/archives. |
| D3 (item 4) | Update feed: no implicit feed; ambient GITHUB_REPOSITORY ignored unless it is goat-si/goat; explicit T3CODE_DESKTOP_UPDATE_REPOSITORY only goat-si/goat; private feed stays off for local builds (publish null). Packaged identity: product "GOAT" / "GOAT (Nightly)", artifact prefix GOAT, own bundle id (si.goat.desktop[.nightly]), own Electron profile; local data home per D9. Passkey provisioning becomes opt-in so a Developer ID or unsigned local build works. |
| D4 (item 3) | SSH_RUNTIME_PROTOCOL_VERSION = 1 in packages/shared; descriptor + server-runtime.json advertise serverVersion, sshRuntimeProtocolVersion, orchestrationProtocolVersion; '<exe> __ssh-helper protocol' prints them. A live or retained runtime is reused across releases only when both protocol integers equal; missing signals never authorize cross-release reuse; incompatible external servers are left running with an error; owned incompatible servers upgrade through D1. Preparation returns the selected runner/version and launch/pairing/MCP carry it. |
| D5 | wp5: build the packaged GOAT app locally (host archive bundled), install to /Applications, replace the running dev desktop (our spawn), verify update-safe switch, bundled-runtime dispatch and protocol reuse on juns-macbook-pro; push goat/ssh-runtime-supply, wait goat-ci green, then fast-forward dev (user push authority; matches prior direct dev pushes). mac-studio replacement when it is online. |
| D9 | Packaged GOAT desktop data home = ~/.goat/desktop (SSH-host state stays ~/.goat, A6). One-time snapshot import (migrate-dev-db rules) from a chosen source; user's copy-vs-fresh answer pending. Electron runtime name kept for Safe Storage (A3). |

## Work-phase map
| WP | Doc | Item |
|---|---|---|
| wp1 | 000/001 + 010_install_before_switch.md | 2 (+ roadmap) |
| wp2 | 020_bundled_runtime.md | 1 |
| wp3 | 030_identity_updates.md | 4 |
| wp4 | 040_protocol_reuse.md | 3 |
| wp5 | 050_stabilize_replace_push.md | stabilize/app/push |

Deviation (known tool constraint, as in 261011_goat-release-rename V1): a docs-only cycle cannot pass SOURCE-DELTA-01, so cycle 1 writes the roadmap in P and implements item 2 in B.


## Writer amendments (2026-10-11)
- D1: preserve the managed PID when an unchanged runner owns the default descriptor; pairing/MCP always retain an existing runner; stale recovery = local-forward closure only; six launch/pairing fixture entries change deliberately (+ MCP fixture repair); guard shell placeholder substitution against `$$`/`$&` replacement patterns (use function replacers).
- D2: CI/release flag forces all three archives; local builds accept host-only; explicit mirror stays ahead of gh but after bundle/cache; `--target host` normalization; release builds Rust resource monitor first; WSL bundled path translated (WSLENV); dev archive home follows dev-runner precedence; frozen fixtures unchanged.
- D3: update feed and passkey provisioning are explicit opt-ins; GOAT profile name with the Electron runtime name kept; Linux portal/URL scheme ids kept (coexistence limit); **D9 home = ~/.goat/desktop (overrides 030's ~/.goat wording; implement 030 §D9 with that path)**; CLI/browser-setup default home follow; copy uses SQLite backup and skips schedules/pending work.
- D4: binary vs live-server signals both required; upgrade needs PID ownership and caller restart authority; selection carried through tunnel/pairing/MCP and rechecked right before use.
