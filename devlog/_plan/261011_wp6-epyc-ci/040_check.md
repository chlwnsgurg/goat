Earlier run 38082452843 @ bfce4301d failed (see 030_build.md); it is superseded, not hidden.

Limits: goat-ci tests only @t3tools/ssh, @t3tools/web and the desktop-artifact script test (narrower than upstream ci.yml). The pre-push hook is an early warning; --no-verify or other clients bypass it and nothing on GitHub enforces goat-ci.yml content.
