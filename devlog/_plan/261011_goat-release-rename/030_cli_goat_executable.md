# 030 — wp4: GOAT executable, archive contract and remote home isolation (D8 + D7-A)

## Loop spec

- Archetype: satisfy-spec; one parent-owned P→A→B→C→D work-phase. This leaf writes the plan only and owns no FSM, loop, goal, branch, or child dispatch.
- Trigger: D8 in `000_plan.md`: users need a `goat` CLI and SSH/WSL/service consumers need GOAT executable/archive bytes.
- Goal: build `goat`/`goat.exe`, package `goat-<version>-<platformKey>.tar.gz` (Windows `.zip`), consume the same names everywhere, expose npm bins `goat` and `t3` from package `t3`, show `goat` in standalone/help/desktop guidance, and isolate remote runtime/state/server home under `~/.goat` through mandatory D7-A.
- Non-goals: npm or GitHub publication, package/scope rename, provider/MCP key rename (wp3/wp6), service-id/protocol/env-var/global-home migration, changing mobile store ids, live service restart, browser/computer-use, upstream shim removal, or tests/builds/install execution by this leaf. D7 is decided: apply D7-A inside wp4; D7-B is discarded and not executable. Remote isolation does not migrate upstream data.
- Verifier: parent runs only named focused tests/typechecks below, inspects archive/signing/CI filename flow and stale-name gates, then independent review. Real SSH belongs to wp5. All test/typecheck/build verifiers here are **NOT RUN**: delegation explicitly forbids execution. Read-only `rg`/`sed`/config reads ground paths and test selection; no exit-code pass is invented.
- Stop: this leaf returns this complete diff-level document. Parent stops wp4 after focused gates and independent review; Completion of mandatory D7-A with isolation proof is required before wp5 server launch.
- Memory artifact: this file in `devlog/_plan/261011_goat-release-rename/`, with parent's evidence directory. Do not commit plan or PR-only evidence.
- Outcomes: PLAN_WRITTEN for this leaf; parent DONE for D8 + D7-A with evidence; NEEDS_HUMAN for unexpected state/service ownership conflicts; BLOCKED for missing toolchain or incompatible earlier-phase signatures.
- Escalation: apply the recorded runtime namespace decision; stop before touching an upstream home, rewriting a live runner, installing a shared service id, publishing, or broadening to other branding/identity work. No child grant was consumed.

## Binding decisions and implementation order

Source root for **all patch paths**: `/Users/jun/Developer/new/700_projects/t3code-lanes/goat-release-rename`.
Baseline is the read-only source at **cd1dfd752d1486948f461eac1ebfb9c16f6cb416**, re-inspected on 2026-10-11. wp2 (`fe8df0d3a`) already changed release acquisition and the retained-runner probe; wp3 (`f08a410af`) already changed MCP tools/server branding and legacy context handoff. **050 (provider-key wp6) is now landed at cd1dfd752**, changing `t3-code` to `goat` across provider adapters, instructions, docs and fixtures. All recorded file-map hashes still match this HEAD. Retain its `goat` namespace and make no provider adapter edits in 030. Core hunks use current before-images; A11 uses core after-images; D7-A uses core + A11 after-images. Preserve wp2's `goat-si/goat` repository, authenticated local gh acquisition, retained-runner branch ordering and ghCommand override. Parent must refresh any overlap introduced after this inspected HEAD.

1. Apply the recorded collision amendment to D8: use `<baseDir>/runtime/goat/versions/<version>` for GOAT pinned runtimes. The core SSH hunks are an intermediate composition stage; mandatory D7-A changes the final remote home to `.goat` while retaining the same `runtime/goat/versions` suffix. User chose `~/.goat` on 2026-10-11 (000 D7 and 002 final disposition). Do not execute or ship the intermediate core-only remote `.t3` paths. It is necessary locally as well: install scripts, serviceLauncher and pinnedRuntime otherwise remove an upstream directory at the same exact version. Never migrate/copy/remove the old `<baseDir>/runtime/versions` tree. A namespace is preferable to rejecting an upstream cache forever, and keeps .install-complete's version-only format intact.
2. Producer/shared naming: SEA output, shared archive resolver, archive builder, npm manifests and both launchers. Keep `bin/t3.js`, `dist/bin.mjs`, `t3.tgz`, @t3code platform-package names and workspace filters.
3. Runtime consumers: pinnedRuntime and standalone serviceLauncher in lockstep, SSH runner/probe/upload, install scripts, WSL verification and backend entry, desktop artifact preflight, smoke consumer, release workflow checksum glob and WSL input glob.
4. Desktop: write `bin/goat` or `goat.cmd`, use a unique GOAT marker and GOAT Windows PATH receipt. Install/remove only GOAT-owned goat links; leave all t3 links/files and upstream markers alone. No automatic legacy shim cleanup.
5. CLI/help and client guidance: CLI root is goat, errors/help/standalone suggestions are goat; `npx t3`, `pnpm dlx t3`, `bunx t3`, npm install/uninstall package arguments stay. npm ownership detection accepts old t3-only manifests and new dual-bin manifests.
6. Existing fixture updates + focused behavioral regression additions. Review frozen SSH fixture as lifecycle-significant bytes, not cosmetic output. The preparation/upload transient runner must still leave an existing managed runner byte-for-byte unchanged; keepExistingRunner remains enabled.
7. Apply **mandatory D7-A inside wp4** after composing core + A11 + wp2/wp3/wp6. D7-B is discarded and not executable; D7-A patches all remote state/home locations together, including pairing/session issuance/stop/log. Never rename run-t3.sh or run-t3.next: cmp/keepExistingRunner and persisted coordination depend on those names.
8. Execute the focused commands and gates, record every exit/outcome; do not substitute local full-suite tests, run CI or launch browsers in this leaf. Parent owns independent review and wp5 authorization.

## Scope and cross-surface accounting

- Web and desktop Settings both expose the same install/remove service through the existing bridge; only labels/search text and the shared desktop backend entry change. No new RPC/schema/permissions or handler IO. CLI server methods retain existing Effect services and scoped process/filesystem dependencies. Standalone serviceLauncher remains its existing Node-only exception.
- Mobile receives only the pairing command hint; shared client-runtime retains the valid `sudo npx t3 browser setup` npm fallback. wp6 has already cut provider MCP registrations over to `goat` before wp4; retain that final namespace while changing executable paths. Entry paths handed to provider subprocesses originate from the changed archive/WSL/backend pipeline.
- Local/SSH/WSL paths are covered. T3 Connect protocol/relay/service ids/AppArmor profile ids, T3CODE_* env vars, local `.t3` default and WSL marker names are preserved. WSL runtime ids are already SHA-256 identities, so renaming archive bytes selects a distinct runtime; no WSL state-dir migration is needed here.
- Release acquisition/auth belongs to wp2. Anonymous installers/update consumers remain subject to D4's private-repository limitation. This plan does not claim public `npx t3` will download GOAT before authorized publishing; current public package ownership stays a separate release concern.
- Source-of-truth sync: update existing user install/background-service/remote-access/welcome/updating guidance and the archive paragraph of existing operations/release.md. No internal file catalog or new architecture page is warranted.
- Production file changes below are MODIFY only; the Windows behavioral test is NEW; no DELETE. No data/schema/enum migration. Tests added inside existing suites exercise actual IO/spawn/ownership behavior, rather than callback wiring/static-render mirrors.

## Review and application instructions

Core unified hunks contain literal cd1dfd752 before-lines, proposed after-lines and context; staged A11/D7-A hunks contain literal preceding-stage after-lines. The table identifies exact absolute paths and action. To execute, parent copies the diff blocks into an external temporary patch and applies them in the authorized source tree, after rechecking any source changes since cd1dfd752; preceding 050 changes are already included in this stale check. Do not copy Markdown prose into a patch. Mandatory D7-A hunks are relative to the **core + A11 after-state**; core-only remote `.t3` paths are not a runnable final implementation. No hunk is applied by this leaf.

The authorizing packet grants this single plan-file write despite AGENTS' default of scratch outside the tree; it grants no source write/test/build/server/git mutation. Parent owns consultation/reflection in 002_architect.md and independent A audit. This document makes no claim that those steps passed.

## A11: preserved GOAT runner readiness (extend wp2's single probe)

Stale check @cd1dfd752: wp2 already implements retained-runner classification in `buildRemoteRuntimeProbeScript` (`packages/ssh/src/tunnel.ts:1059–1105`) and consumes its retained result before acquisition in `prepareRemoteRuntime` (`:1128–1167`). The retained-runner regression table is `packages/ssh/src/tunnel.test.ts:822–1004`. These anchors refer to the inspected source before this plan's projected changes.

Contract: with `keepExistingRunner` and a state key, the existing probe reads the preserved runner's `T3_NODE_SCRIPT_PATH` / `T3_ARCHIVE_VERSION` assignments without sourcing or executing it. Archive versions retain wp2's exact-version validation. Archive retained readiness requires executable presence and the matching `.install-complete` version at **`~/.goat/runtime/goat/versions/<retainedVersion>/goat`**. A ready older or unmarked GOAT runner is reused as wp2 specifies; its version need not equal the requesting client's version. Node-script runners retain wp2's ready classification. No GOAT script marker or new compatibility mechanism is introduced.

`retained: ready` returns before local-cache reads, gh download, mirror acquisition or upload and annotates `t3.runtime.source=retained-runner`. `retained: missing` raises the existing clear `SshLaunchError` before any acquisition, launch or MCP issuance, even with an explicit mirror. Preserve this branch ordering, the schema's optional `retained` / `retainedVersion` fields, `prepareRemoteRuntime(..., stateKey)`, its launch/MCP callers and `runner?.ghCommand`. No second SSH probe, install-alongside helper or forced same-version restart gate belongs in 030.

This A11 block moves the probe's runner lookup to `~/.goat/ssh-launch/<stateKey>/run-t3.sh` and its retained executable directly to D7-A's final root. The ordinary current-version probe and every other runner/home/state path finish their move in D7-A below. Apply core → A11 → D7-A as one unit; intermediate states are not runnable. Never import upstream `.t3` ownership/runtime data. Keep run-t3.sh and run-t3.next names and keepExistingRunner/leaveRemoteServerRunning behavior.

Pairing retains wp2's current-build preparation and existing runner replacement behavior: preparation receives no state key, unlike launch and MCP issuance. The existing `entry=pairing, mode=ready` regression therefore continues to expect probe → gh → upload → pairing. This leaf does not broaden retained-runner reuse to pairing or change that lifecycle. Its default server home still becomes `~/.goat` through D7-A.

Execution order remains wp2 → wp3 → **wp6 (`050_provider_key_goat.md`)** → wp4 (`030`) → wp5. 050 owns provider adapter changes; 030 contains no provider adapter hunks. Recheck later parent overlap without undoing wp2's goat-si/goat acquisition or wp3's goat MCP names.

### A11 exact hunks — tunnel.test.ts (relative to core after-state)

Extend wp2's existing table and real-shell probe fixture. Ready covers an older retained version with no extra marker; missing, marker-only, non-executable and wrong-marker cases fail before cache/gh/upload, including explicit mirror configuration. Upstream-only seeds a runnable upstream t3 and matching marker under `.t3/runtime/versions`; it cannot satisfy GOAT readiness and its bytes survive. Existing invalid-version, node-mode, cold-start, pairing and managed-server cases remain. D7-A moves the remaining remote state/current-build paths together.

Parent proof: retain the named SSH focused suites and typecheck below; observe ready → reuse and missing → clear error at launch/MCP entry points, no acquisition/cache reads in either retained branch, and preserved runner bytes. Retain `runtimeArchiveGh.test.ts`'s spaced `ghCommand` override case (asset names derive from `cliArchiveFileName`, so no literal filename hunk is needed). Frozen oracle changes only executable/archive/runtime/home bytes; no new marker or pairing gate is inserted. All execution verifiers remain **NOT RUN by this leaf**.

## D7-A (mandatory in wp4): remote ~/.goat

**MANDATORY; D7 decided by user 2026-10-11 (`~/.goat`).** Apply inside wp4 after core + A11 and preserve the wp2/wp3/wp6 union, to both server and desktop consumers via the shared tunnel service. Remote runtime becomes `~/.goat/runtime/goat/versions/<version>`, state becomes `~/.goat/ssh-launch/<stateKey>`, and default server/pairing/MCP-session home becomes `~/.goat`. The redundant runtime/goat suffix is deliberate: GOAT service install/pinnedRuntime and install scripts use the same home-relative layout, regardless of local/remote home. Do not make remote runner use runtime/versions while the service launcher expects runtime/goat/versions.

No automatic import of `.t3` pid/port/managed/runner/database files. Existing upstream managed/default servers therefore remain outside GOAT discovery/stop/restart scope. keepExistingRunner follows wp2 retained-runner semantics within the GOAT namespace (A11): a ready older/unmarked runner is reused; a missing selected GOAT runtime fails before acquisition. leaveRemoteServerRunning protects the remote server when the local forward ends.

## D7-B: discarded / not executable

The user chose D7-A (`~/.goat`) on 2026-10-11. Keeping remote state or server home under `~/.t3` is discarded; do not apply it, run its former verification gates, or use core-only remote `.t3` after-images as the final implementation. Upstream `~/.t3/userdata`, its runner and ownership files remain untouched. Any GOAT `.t3` paths in core/projected hunks are intermediate before-images for D7-A; explicit upstream-preservation fixtures retain `.t3`; local default-home/service-id limitations remain separately recorded.

PowerShell has an exact NEW test hunk in `scripts/install-windows.test.ts`: real install.ps1 through a local HTTP/ZIP fixture using a copied native Node executable as the --version stand-in. It checks marker-only/broken entries force download, runnable cache avoids archive download, goat.cmd runs, and upstream runtime/t3.cmd survives. This proves installer behavior, not GOAT SEA output; hosted artifact smoke owns that proof. It skips non-Windows; a macOS skip is not Windows evidence. The 120-second harness timeout bounds native compression/extraction; it never sleeps or polls for orchestration completion.

## Verification recipes (parent only; NOT RUN by leaf)

The single **Verification bundle** at the end selects the same 28 focused test files (27 existing, one planned NEW Windows suite) after integrating core + A11 + mandatory D7-A. Every test invocation runs from its owning package directory with package-relative paths. Shared/ssh/scripts use the explicit root config and `--dir .`, matching their package.json recipes; server/desktop/client-runtime use their own configs; web uses its package recipe's `--project unit`. Deliberately omit `--passWithNoTests`: each named file must be discovered. Record each exit; no-tests-found is a failure. wp2's `runtimeArchiveGh.test.ts` spaced `ghCommand` override remains mandatory.

The eight named typecheck configs exist: scripts includes `**/*.ts`; shared/ssh/client-runtime include `src`; server and desktop include `src` plus their config/script inputs; web includes `src` plus config/vite/script inputs; mobile inherits Expo's default includes. These commands observe code and test targets, not this prose plan; human review verifies plan completeness.

Expected exit 0 for tests/typechecks; Linux/Windows installer tests **SKIP on macOS** is not installer proof. From the source `scripts` package directory, run `vp test run --config ../vite.config.ts --dir . install.test.ts` on existing Linux CI and `vp test run --config ../vite.config.ts --dir . install-windows.test.ts` on existing Windows CI or authorized test hosts. Do not install a new runner/package or substitute a broad suite. Record baseline failures separately; missing dependencies/config/tool are BLOCKED. No repo-wide vp check or recursive test/typecheck. SEA/signing/archive output needs wp5's authorized local build plus hosted target-specific Windows/Linux builds; tests do not prove cross-platform binaries exist.

### Stale-name gates

Run these gates from `/Users/jun/Developer/new/700_projects/t3code-lanes/goat-release-rename` (reset cwd after the package test blocks).

`rg` empty means exit **1**, not exit 0. Errors (exit 2) fail the gate. Each expected-empty command scopes out intentional npm identities, native helpers, historical ids and frozen templates except where stated.

Mandatory D7-A gates:

```sh
# Expected empty (exit 1): every production remote script now uses .goat.
rg -n '\$HOME/\.t3' packages/ssh/src/tunnel.ts
# Expected matching output: runner, upload and probe runtime roots; all launch/pairing/session/stop/log states; default home.
rg -n '\$HOME/\.goat|DEFAULT_SERVER_HOME|STATE_DIR|runtime=' packages/ssh/src/tunnel.ts
```

For the pipeline help gate, inspect each stage exit: first rg may return 1 (no input), second rg should return 1 (all retained matches are allowed npm runner invocations). Shell pipeline success/failure alone is not sufficient if the first stage errors. Gates are early warnings (human executing rg/source review, known bypass: other unlisted files/new spellings; residual risk: missed consumers; final layer none). Behavior/targeted CI and archive inspection are the deciding evidence.

## Risks, rollback and amendment requests

- **Recorded D8 amendment:** apply `runtime/goat/versions` namespace for local+remote archives and independent Windows desktop PATH ownership receipt. Mandatory D7-A also isolates remote home/state. Core-only remote `.t3` paths are intermediate hunks, not the final wp4 implementation.
- **D7 decided:** mandatory remote runtime is `~/.goat/runtime/goat/versions/<v>`, not a home-relative layout inconsistent with pinnedRuntime/serviceLauncher. D7-A is an isolated new home; no migration of user data or persisted ownership is proposed.
- **D4 limitation remains:** private repo + unauthenticated install/update consumers can still fail; rename/auth code does not publish releases or npm packages. Public install URLs t3.codes still represent upstream infrastructure, and public npm t3 may serve upstream. Parent must preserve this distinction in wp5 evidence and final reporting.
- **Existing service ids/local home remain shared:** no service install/update/uninstall/restart is authorized against a live upstream installation. Namespaced runtime does not isolate service plans/receipts. A later default-home/service-id policy would require explicit scope/decision amendment.
- **Baseline bytes cause lifecycle change:** ordinary launch mode legitimately flags changed managed runner; keepExistingRunner must remain true for second-client paths. run-t3.sh retention does not transform an old runner into GOAT. A11 extends wp2's single retained probe: ready older/unmarked GOAT runners reuse their selected runtime; missing selected runtimes fail before download/upload, leaving the runner unchanged. Mandatory D7-A avoids importing upstream coordination; D7-B is discarded and not executable.
- **Windows fixture scope:** the new installer harness tests a path with spaces and actual goat.cmd execution. Desktop shim suites retain existing Unicode/codepage tests. Standalone install/update cmd shim Unicode/codepage behavior predates this rename and is not changed here; if it fails on a particular Windows host, record that baseline and amend a separate quoting/encoding fix rather than treating an ASCII-host run as general Unicode proof.
- **Cache checks:** matching version marker alone was accepted by installers; POSIX adds -x + runnable --version; Windows adds leaf executable + runnable --version. Namespace provides product ownership, not output branding. SSH probe still uses executable+marker presence (existing readiness contract), upload runner validates before publishing. Do not add unrelated checksum revalidation of all warm caches in wp4.
- **Rollback before deployment:** restore the edited source hunks as one parent-controlled unit, then rerun focused tests. Never apply name rollback to only producer or only consumers; archive/executable names must stay matched. No branch-level git action by this leaf.
- **Rollback after a future authorized run:** disconnect local tunnel without stopping remote (`leaveRemoteServerRunning`); keep both old/new runtime trees and run-t3.sh state for inspection. Parent chooses any service handoff with explicit live-service authorization. Do not delete `.goat`, `.t3`, archives, pid/port files, or user DB as automatic rollback. Newly added desktop goat links may be removed only through GOAT-owned link checks; upstream t3 remains untouched. Publishing/release rollback is out of scope.

## Leaf proof boundary

This stale-check leaf read the delegation owner, current plan/ordering and source bytes at cd1dfd752, then compared every core + A11 + D7-A before-image against source or the literal preceding-stage projection in memory. All 385 hunks match, including exact context and old/new line counts; the NEW Windows test has an absent source before-image. All recorded source hashes match. Selective Codex/Aside/kim_wiki memory lookup found no relevant overriding rename decision. Only this document is written. No source edit, build, test, install, server, SSH connection, git mutation, FSM/goal call, child spawn or browser/computer-use occurred. Static plan/source comparisons do not establish implementation, test pass, READY or release status. Parent owns execution and independent review of the landed wp2/wp3/wp6 union plus wp4.

## Verification bundle

Parent only; **NOT RUN** by this leaf. All test recipes run from their owning package directories; the final eight typechecks run from the source root. Run installer suites on their named target hosts for non-skip evidence.

## Audit fold (cycle 4)

1. Blocker: packages/shared/src/legacyCliLauncher.test.ts fixture executable renamed from `…/t3` to `…/goat` (matching the launcher hunk at line ~400); add `src/legacyCliLauncher.test.ts` to the shared command in the Verification bundle.
2. Fix: do NOT introduce new hosting domains. Every hunk that writes `goat.codes`, `app.goat.codes` or similar new URLs keeps the established URL (`t3.codes`, `app.t3.codes`, existing install URLs) while still renaming the command/executable to `goat` where the command itself is described. GOAT hosting is out of scope (no deploy authority).
