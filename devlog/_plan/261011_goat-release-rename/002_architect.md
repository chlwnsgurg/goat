# 002 — Architect consultation

Architect: gpt-6.1-sol, handle 01a12792-c79e-7b50-9b74-17cdfcc3ca9b (read-only). Proposal reviewed 000_plan.md D1–D9 + 001_inventory.md; returned A1–A13.

| ID | Verdict | Main disposition |
|---|---|---|
| A1 (D1) | ACCEPT | Accepted. Keep upstream URLs that are attribution (triage prompt repo links, NodePty PR comment, model-manifest raw URL) or T3 Connect untouched; 010 lists the allowlist. |
| A2 (D2) | AMEND | Accepted: scoped temp download, exact-asset checksum required, atomic cache publish, keep SHA256SUMS next to cached archive (`<asset>.sha256` sidecar) so a cached gh download stays verifiable; reject unsupported platform before gh. |
| A3 (D3) | AMEND | Accepted: archive runners without archiveDirectory get the default `<baseDir>/runtime/archives` at the call sites (desktop already does; server already does) and prepareRemoteRuntime no longer silently skips for archive runners; normalize empty mirror; server dispatch forwards `T3CODE_RELEASE_BASE_URL`; gh runs with `GH_PROMPT_DISABLED=1`, bounded timeout, stderr truncated. |
| A4 (D4) | ACCEPT | Recorded as unsupported-against-private-repo limitation in final report. |
| A5 (D5) | AMEND | Accepted with scope: alias map for presentation + replay/handoff recognition; aliases never grant permissions. ACP/OpenCode qualified recovery handled in wp6. |
| A6 (D6) | AMEND | Accepted: provider key `goat`; wp6 runs before wp4/wp5. Legacy namespace recognition separate from Claude read-only approvals. |
| A7 (D7) | AMEND, recommend ~/.goat | Matches Finding F1. Decided by user 2026-10-11: ~/.goat (historical: was pending when first recorded). No automatic migration of ~/.t3. run-t3.sh filename kept inside new root. |
| A8 (D8) | AMEND | Accepted: npm `t3` bin is compat alias; desktop shim claims only `goat`. |
| A9 (D9) | AMEND | Accepted: hermetic gh tests; wp5 verifies archive identity, launched executable path, isolated server home, probe turn completion. |
| A10 | risk | Accepted: gh resolved after login-shell env install; 010 adds a gh path override option and explicit "gh not found on PATH" error. |
| A11 | risk | Accepted: with keepExistingRunner, a reused runner that is not GOAT's (different root) cannot occur once D7=~/.goat; otherwise fail clearly, never implicit restart. |
| A12 | ordering | Accepted: wp2 → wp3 → wp6 → wp4 → wp5. |
| A13 | proof gaps | Folded into 010/030/040 test lists where meaningful (concurrent cache publish, checksum failure, mirror propagation, minimal PATH). |

Executable plan revision sent for reflection: 000_plan.md + 010/020/030/040/050 after writers finish (reflection recorded below).

## Reflection

- Reflection 1 (same handle 01a12792-c79e): MISALIGNED. Gaps in 010 (A2 sidecar, A3 prompt/timeout/stderr/server mirror, A10 ghCommand + PATH proof, A13 concurrency), 030 (A11 preserved older GOAT runner), wp6 ordering text in 000/020/050, 040 (SEA build, resource monitor, binary identity, launched-process evidence, rollback). Folded by amender leaves 01a127a1-09ba (010), 01a127a1-0b18 (030/020/050) and main (040/000).
- Reflection 2: MISALIGNED with one gap (040 step 3 assumed a cold remote version). Folded by main: live gh failure only on a cold version, else UNOBSERVED plus hermetic wp2 tests.
- D7 final: user chose ~/.goat (2026-10-11); 030 D7-A becomes mandatory, D7-B discarded.
- Status: reflection gaps resolved; independent audit A1 (01a127a9-0c7a) FAIL with 3 blockers, folded before re-audit (see 003_audit.md).
