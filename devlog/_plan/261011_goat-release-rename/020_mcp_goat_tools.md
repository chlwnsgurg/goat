# 020 — wp3: GOAT MCP names and persisted-history aliases (D5)

## Stale check @fe8df0d3a

- Confirmed source HEAD `fe8df0d3a8156d58b6a191384ee068e9e2b1a85a` by reading the worktree gitdir/HEAD and its resolved ref; no git command or branch operation was used. Rechecked all **218 hunks in 54 files**, including declared old-line positions/counts and ordered in-memory reconstruction. **Amended source hunks: 0**; every before-image still matches.
- Re-read wp2's `SshRemoteDispatch.ts` and `.test.ts`. All dispatch rename hunks remain applicable alongside the new `resolveSshCliRunner` release-mirror path. The test has no exact 42-name occurrence and needs no wp3 hunk; its new mirror/default-acquisition tests remain intact. These helper/result/mirror tests do not prove remote MCP request dispatch.
- Updated the source-base description and verification recipes: the five root-config test files now run from their owning mobile/provider/shared package directories with `--config ../../vite.config.ts --dir .`; web explicitly selects `--project unit`. The same 23 test files remain selected. Server and client-runtime retain their own package configs; all eight targeted typecheck configs exist and cover the stated scope.
- Confirmed the PCRE2 alternation is exactly the 42-name contract. Read-only `rg` scans of source bytes reconstructed in memory yield no stale names outside the two compatibility files; those files contain 42 + 42 matching lines. Other planned gates yield 42 GOAT declarations, 0 old declarations, 1 GOAT server-name line, 15 Claude qualified names and 3 SSH call names. These are plan-consistency observations, not executed application/test/typecheck proof. No source writes, builds or tests occurred.

## Loop spec

- Archetype: satisfy-spec; one bounded wp3 implementation cycle owned by the parent. This leaf is a plan writer and invokes no FSM, loop or goals.
- Trigger: D5 in `000_plan.md`: the user chose `goat_*` MCP tool names and a server named GOAT.
- Goal: advertise and call exactly 42 renamed `goat_*` tools; initialize with `serverInfo.name = "GOAT"`; render existing `t3_*` history with its original labels, summary actions and tool identity.
- Non-goals: provider registration key `t3-code` (D6/wp6), `mcp__t3-code__` namespaces, CLI/archive names (D8/wp4), release acquisition (wp2), display-label/logo rebranding, DB migrations, callable legacy aliases, environment variable or unrelated `t3_*` identifiers. No source writes, installs, builds, tests, servers, browsers, git mutations or child spawns by this leaf.
- Verifier: the exact scoped test/typecheck commands and stale-name gates below. Observable criteria: public catalog contains 42 GOAT names and no old callable names, renamed calls preserve service behavior and permissions, handshake reports GOAT, old and new history names resolve to the same presentation while foreign namespaces remain generic. Parent supplies independent final-source review.
- Stop: this leaf returns the completed single decade document. Parent wp3 stops when the patch, focused gates and independent review pass; failing proof remains unresolved.
- Memory artifact: `devlog/_plan/261011_goat-release-rename/020_mcp_goat_tools.md`; parent records execution evidence in the owning unit's `evidence/`. This does not authorize memory-store writes.
- Outcomes: PLAN_READY for this leaf (executable source-grounded plan, not implementation proof); parent DONE only after fresh evidence; NEEDS_HUMAN for a D5/D6 compatibility choice; BLOCKED for missing dependency/toolchain or source drift requiring parent repair.
- Escalation: any change to provider keys/namespace parsing, legacy callable dispatch, schema semantics, service permission policy, live state, source files outside the manifest, or the number of renamed tools. Parent owns architect reflection and A review; no consultation spawn is authorized for this leaf.

## Scope, source and decisions

Read `000_plan.md` (D1–D9) and `001_inventory.md` first, then verified actual tool definitions, handler keys, consumers and tests through source reads. Source root is **/Users/jun/Developer/new/700_projects/t3code-lanes/goat-release-rename**. The roadmap records original base `dfd768cb5`; this stale check verified current HEAD `fe8df0d3a8156d58b6a191384ee068e9e2b1a85a` after wp2 through read-only git metadata. All 218 before-images and their declared old-line positions match the current source. Hunks below use source bytes rather than the inventory's approximate line numbers. If source moves after this check, the parent must re-read matching anchors before applying.

All source changes below are MODIFY; no NEW or DELETE source files. The only file this leaf writes is this document. The 52 existing files containing one of the exact 42 names expand to **54 MODIFY files** after adding a GOAT handshake assertion in `McpHttpServer.test.ts` and the server-name change in `McpHttpServer.ts`. This is D5's name propagation, not a new provider-key phase.

The implementation keeps the existing Effect service boundaries. Toolkit declarations and handler property names change together, but handlers still decode, authorize, call the same service method and map its errors. No transport-owned retry, filesystem action, migration, or business logic is added. `SshRemoteDispatch` keeps its existing service flow and changes only remote `tools/call` names/advice. The shared alias lookup is pure read-side presentation/identity recovery.

Canonical presentation entries use GOAT names. An explicit 42-entry legacy map points each old name at its canonical definition. `T3_MCP_TOOL_NAMES` is a read-side inventory consumed by ACP identity recovery, not a registration list: it contains canonical entries and intentional legacy aliases. `resolveT3McpToolId` preserves the actual old/new name so parsing persisted provider history does not rewrite identities. `resolveT3McpToolDefinition` normalizes only for presentation. Existing `t3_thread_start` stays a historical presentation entry: it is not one of the 42 live names and no `goat_thread_start` is invented.

Execution order (A12): **wp2 → wp3 → wp6 → wp4 → wp5**. wp3 hands its bare-tool changes to wp6 before executable/archive integration and the remote probe.

During wp3 only, provider-qualified names are `mcp__t3-code__goat_thread_read` / `t3-code.goat_thread_read`. Do not rename `T3_MCP_SERVER_ALIASES`, its accepted server prefixes, `T3Mcp*` types/functions, `t3-code` logo discriminators, provider configuration, token variables, XML instruction tags or imported file names. The server's displayed protocol name GOAT and its provider registration key are different inputs. wp6 immediately follows wp3 and changes the key to `goat`; wp4 consumes that final namespace and wp5 probes `mcp__goat__goat_*` names in a fresh provider session.

SoT sync: update the already-existing `docs/orchestration-v2/orchestrator-mcp-server.md` tool names using the exact hunks below. Contracts' existing descriptions, recovery prompts and tool descriptions also follow. Do not add an implementation catalog to `docs/internals/`. This plan remains a local parent-owned work artifact and is not PR material.

## Exact rename contract

The 42 names are six orchestrator, sixteen thread, seven project, three worktree, three SSH, three attachment, two environment and two preview-controls tools. All other 41 live tool names stay unchanged (83 total).

The exact bounded PCRE2 stale-name expression is below. Its missing left boundary is intentional: it must also find a tool suffix inside `mcp__t3-code__t3_thread_read`; `\bt3_` would miss those underscore-joined names. The right guard prevents matching longer unrelated identifiers. Do not perform a blanket `s/t3_/goat_/g`.

## Ordered implementation steps (parent B only)

1. Re-read D5/D6 and the listed anchors in the source worktree after wp2; run the read-only source gates below to confirm 42 current live names. Resolve material source drift before applying.
2. Apply the full atomic source plan below: canonical presentation map plus read-side aliases; the eight toolkit declarations and handlers; the GOAT server name; consumers, Claude read-only qualified suffixes and remote SSH calls; then the existing guidance and test fixtures. The bounded names are the only mechanical transformation. No provider key changes.
3. Run the focused tests and targeted typechecks below. Observe renamed calls through production registrations, not mocked replacement callbacks. Do not start a dev server or any agent. Preserve existing effect-worker drain / persisted-event waits in the integration test; no sleep/polling additions.
4. Run stale-name, registration and namespace gates; inspect intentional compatibility output and the independent public-name contract. Repair only this manifest and report expansion to the parent.
5. Parent obtains independent final-source review, records command exit codes and outcomes under the owning unit, and hands the verified source to wp6, which cuts the provider namespace over to `goat` before wp4 and wp5. An unrun command is not PASS. Do not push, PR, merge, release or restart the live app as part of wp3.

## Copy-paste application (parent B only)

This is a future implementation command, **NOT RUN by the leaf**. It writes only the manifest's source files when executed by the parent in B. It extracts the one complete patch fence from this document into an external scratch file, checks all hunks first, then applies. `patch` is used so this recipe performs no branch, commit or index operation. Do not run this recipe from the documentation checkout. A failed dry run means re-read source and amend hunks; never force/reverse guessed hunks or continue with a partial application.

````sh
set -eu
cd /Users/jun/Developer/new/700_projects/t3code-lanes/goat-release-rename
wp3_patch=$(mktemp /tmp/goat-wp3.XXXXXX)
trap 'rm -f "$wp3_patch"' EXIT
python3 - /Users/jun/Developer/new/700_projects/goat/devlog/_plan/261011_goat-release-rename/020_mcp_goat_tools.md "$wp3_patch" <<'PATCH_EXTRACT'
from pathlib import Path
import re, sys
blocks = re.findall(r"^```diff\n(.*?)^```$", Path(sys.argv[1]).read_text(), re.M | re.S)
assert len(blocks) == 1, "expected one complete source patch"
Path(sys.argv[2]).write_text(blocks[0])
PATCH_EXTRACT
patch --dry-run -p1 < "$wp3_patch"
patch -p1 < "$wp3_patch"
````

## Complete before/after hunks

These are conventional unified diffs with real current before-lines and complete after-lines. They can be applied together using the recipe above. They include all 54 files, all 42 canonical presentation key changes, all 42 explicit legacy aliases, and all changed call sites/test fixtures. Nothing is elided from a changed line.

 The \`t3-code\` MCP server provides app-owned orchestration. Treat these concepts distinctly:

 - A delegated task/subagent is child work owned by the current thread. Use \`orchestrator_capabilities\` to discover the current provider/model IDs from the same live catalog as the composer, including configured custom models. Do not treat a native tool's model list as the full list of available subagent models. Prefer native subagent tools for same-provider work only when they support the chosen model. Use \`delegate_task\` with that provider instance and model when native tools cannot, including for same-provider work. Also use \`delegate_task\` for cross-provider or explicitly T3-owned child tasks. Retain each returned \`taskId\`, and use \`task_status\` or \`task_cancel\` to manage it. The returned \`childThreadId\` is backing storage for the subagent, not the target for starting another delegated review round.
-- \`t3_thread_launch\` and \`create_threads\` create ordinary top-level T3 conversations. Use them only when the user explicitly asks for separate/new/top-level threads or conversations. Never use them merely because the user said "subagent" or requested parallel delegated work.
-- For every T3 delegated review round, call \`delegate_task\` again. Include the original brief, prior findings, responses, and unresolved objections in each new task prompt. Track each round by its own \`taskId\`. Use a distinct \`clientRequestId\` per round, stable across retries of that round. Do not use \`t3_thread_send\` on \`childThreadId\` to continue a delegated review.

Do not use \`goat_thread_send\` on \`childThreadId\` to continue a delegated review.
 - \`schedule_task\` creates persistent recurring work in the app scheduler. Pass \`schedule\` as a structured object, never as JSON text: \`{"type":"interval","everyMs":3600000}\` for an interval, or \`{"type":"fixed_time","timeOfDay":"09:00","weekdays":[1,2,3,4,5]}\` for a wall-clock schedule, or \`{"type":"webhook"}\` to run on each request to the returned \`webhookUrl\` (the run sees the request only through \`{{body.path}}\`-style placeholders in the prompt). By default runs return to the current thread, which suits orchestrating: each trigger arrives here and you delegate or dedupe; set \`bindToCurrentThread=false\` only when the user wants a fresh thread for every run. After scheduling a timer, report the returned cadence and next run time; for a webhook, report its \`webhookUrl\`, or say T3 Connect remote access is needed if it is missing.
 - When you need a secret from the user (a token, API key, or webhook signing secret), call \`request_secret\` so they enter it privately, then pass the returned \`secretRef\` to the tool that needs it, e.g. \`signature.secretRef\` on a webhook task for a sender that signs requests such as GitHub. A \`secretRef\` works once. Never ask for a secret in chat, never invent one, and never repeat one.
 - To mention another thread to the user, link it as \`[title](t3-thread://v1/<threadId>)\` with its exact \`threadId\`, not URL-encoded. T3 Code opens the thread in the app and shows its current title.

 ### Choose the workspace before starting a new thread

-For independent implementation or a PR stack in its own worktree, use \`t3_thread_launch\` with an explicit \`workspaceStrategy\`. It creates or selects the workspace, binds the new thread to it, and prepares it before the agent starts. Put the task in \`message\`, not \`prompt\`:

 - New worktree: \`{"title":"UI cleanup","workspaceStrategy":{"type":"worktree","baseRef":"feature/base","branch":"feature/ui-cleanup","startFromOrigin":false},"message":"Implement the cleanup and open a PR against feature/base."}\`
 - Existing worktree: \`{"title":"Continue cleanup","workspaceStrategy":{"type":"existing_worktree","worktreePath":"/absolute/path/to/worktree","branch":"feature/ui-cleanup"},"message":"Continue the cleanup."}\`
 - Project's main checkout: \`workspaceStrategy:{"type":"root"}\`. Omitting workspaceStrategy also selects root; it does not inherit the caller's worktree.

-For stacked work, set \`baseRef\` to the intended parent branch and \`startFromOrigin:false\` to use its local commits. Use \`startFromOrigin:true\` when you intend to fetch and start from origin. Uncommitted edits are not copied. Use \`t3_worktree_list\` to discover existing checkout paths. Project, model selection, and modes inherit unless supplied; a launched thread may not run with broader modes than yours.

Asking an agent to run \`git worktree add\` or \`cd\` in its prompt does not update T3's thread binding.

-To work on ANOTHER machine, use the SSH tools instead of running ssh in a terminal: \`t3_ssh_host_list\` names the hosts this machine can reach, \`t3_ssh_browse\` lists a folder there with its Git branch and worktrees, and \`t3_ssh_thread_launch\` starts a thread in that machine's own T3 environment, in the folder (\`workspace:{"type":"cwd"}\`) or a new worktree (\`{"type":"worktree","branch":"feature/x"}\`). Its threadId belongs to that machine, so \`t3_thread_read\` here cannot read it; tell the user to connect that host in Settings to follow it.

 Tool names may include a harness-normalized MCP prefix, such as \`mcp__t3_code__delegate_task\`; the semantics are the same. Some harnesses attach optional MCP servers lazily: if an initial tool-catalog scan does not show T3 tools, do not conclude that cross-provider delegation is unavailable. Make one bounded direct attempt using the known T3 tool name on the next tool step. In Codex code mode, for example, call \`tools.mcp__t3_code__orchestrator_capabilities({})\` before reporting that the capability is absent. Keep polling/wait loops bounded, do not duplicate active work, and use stable \`clientRequestId\` values when retrying tools that accept them.

Registration rejection of legacy names is proven at catalog level here (no old registration/handler key remains), not by migrating or rewriting a database. Running an old live session against the newly renamed server is intentionally unsupported by D5's read-side-only compatibility promise.

## Exact verification commands

**All test/typecheck/application commands below: NOT RUN** by this leaf because the packet forbids builds, tests, servers and source edits. No exit code or PASS is asserted. Paths/configuration were read to ground them. `vp test run` receives named files only; no `vp check`, recursive test/typecheck, or repo-wide suite is permitted. Execute each command independently and record its exit code; expected success is 0, with no failures and no no-tests-found result.

Root `vite.config.ts` supplies the node test environment and excludes `.repos`, `.t3`, node_modules and build outputs. Server uses its own `vite.config.ts` (serial file execution and git test setup), web uses its own test project (and `MessagesTimeline.test.tsx` declares jsdom), and client-runtime uses its own `src/**/*.test.ts` include. The package commands below run in the owning package so relative configuration paths resolve correctly. Mobile, provider-acp, provider-core and shared use their package.json test recipe (`--config ../../vite.config.ts --dir .`); web selects its `unit` project without permitting an empty selection. All 23 named test paths were checked for existence; these are future execution recipes, not test results.

Targeted typecheck scopes and grounding: `packages/shared`, `contracts`, `provider-core`, `provider-acp`, and `client-runtime` all declare `include: ["src"]`; `apps/server` declares `include: ["src", "vite.config.ts", "scripts", "integration", "../../scripts/lib"]`; web includes its `src` and configuration/test support paths; mobile extends Expo's config and uses default source inclusion. Every touched TypeScript file belongs to one of these eight configs. Desktop inherits the web bundle and shared rendering; no Electron IPC code or mobile native code changes. These commands check only those packages, not the repository's recursive script.

The shell variable below contains the exact 42-name expression. Use it unchanged for both stale gates. It is deliberately narrower than `t3_`, so unrelated context/turn/PTY/metrics names are outside this gate.

```sh
cd /Users/jun/Developer/new/700_projects/t3code-lanes/goat-release-rename

rg -n --pcre2 "$wp3_old_names" apps packages docs \
  -g '!packages/shared/src/t3McpToolPresentation.ts' \
  -g '!packages/shared/src/t3McpToolPresentation.test.ts'
```

Expected: **empty output, rg exit 1**. Any printed occurrence fails wp3. This includes qualified provider strings and tests/comments; only the two explicit read-side alias files are excluded. No `t3-code` namespace exception is needed because this regex targets suffixes only.

```sh
rg -n --pcre2 "$wp3_old_names" \
  packages/shared/src/t3McpToolPresentation.ts \
  packages/shared/src/t3McpToolPresentation.test.ts
```

Expected: **84 lines, rg exit 0** — exactly 42 explicit source alias-map entries and 42 explicit compatibility-test pairs. Old canonical definition keys and old live example fixtures were renamed; any extra hit requires inspection. `t3_thread_start` is an existing read-only entry outside the exact 42-name regex.

```sh
rg -n 'Tool\.make\("goat_' apps/server/src/mcp/toolkits
rg -n 'Tool\.make\("t3_' apps/server/src/mcp/toolkits
rg -n 'name: "(T3 Code|GOAT)"' apps/server/src/mcp/McpHttpServer.ts
rg -n 'mcp__t3-code__goat_' apps/server/src/orchestration-v2/Adapters/ClaudeAdapterV2.ts
rg -n 'tool: "goat_(project_list|project_create|thread_launch)"' \
  apps/server/src/sshRemote/SshRemoteDispatch.ts
```

Expected in order: 42 GOAT declarations (exit 0); no old declarations (exit 1); one `name: "GOAT"` transport line (exit 0); 15 renamed Claude read-only qualified suffixes (exit 0); exactly 3 remote-call lines (exit 0). Do not accept an exit 0 stale-name scan as a pass: that means matches were found.

Read-only compatibility/namespace checkpoint:

```sh
rg -n 'T3_MCP_SERVER_ALIASES|const namespaceMatch|const prefixed|\^t3-code-' \
  packages/shared/src/t3McpToolPresentation.ts
rg -n 'CLAUDE_T3_MCP_TOOL_WILDCARD|mcp__t3-code__\*' \
  apps/server/src/orchestration-v2/Adapters/ClaudeAdapterV2.ts
```

Expected allowed output: current `t3-code` / `t3_code` / `t3code` server-alias set and parser prefixes plus the current `mcp__t3-code__*` wildcard. Those are D6-owned inputs, intentionally unchanged in wp3. Review the patch for absence of provider config/key edits; a grep cannot prove that unrelated changes were not made by another lane.

## Risks, rollback and handoff

- Canonical name changes break already-running sessions that cached old advertised tools. History aliases solve display/summary/identity recovery only. Parent must arrange fresh provider sessions as part of authorized integration; this plan does not authorize restarting the user's live GOAT/T3 app or adding callable aliases.
- Mixed-version SSH endpoints still exposing old tools reject GOAT calls. After wp6 and wp4, wp5 must prepare a GOAT runtime built from the integrated source and probe the final `mcp__goat__goat_*` names in a fresh provider session. Do not silently fall back to an old remote endpoint or route old names via presentation aliases.
- ACP uses `T3_MCP_TOOL_NAMES` to recover identity. Keeping explicit old names in that set is required so legacy activity remains attributable; canonical suffixes must also be present. Do not use this read-side inventory as the live MCP registration list. The core test checks the actual toolkit inventory separately.
- A blanket prefix replacement would corrupt unrelated identifiers and registration keys. This plan changes the exact 42 suffixes only; the stale gate is bounded and checks underscore-joined qualified names.
- The source may move between docs-first P and wp3 B. Dry-run the exact patch and re-read any drifted hunk. Earlier phases changing unrelated lines do not justify inventing before-lines or suppressing failures.
- Rollback is a coordinated source change across the full manifest (use the parent-owned saved patch in reverse only after confirming no intervening edits). Reverse server/tool/handler/approval/remote-call suffixes together; retain the shared GOAT presentation entries as read-side aliases for GOAT history already produced. Removing those aliases would make new persisted history generic. Do not reverse a live database, remove threads or restore a shared branch/HEAD. Parent decides how to preserve interim GOAT history before a deployed rollback.
- No local proof here establishes CI READY, merged, published, deployed or a successful SSH probe. Parent records actual verifier outcomes and independent review; wp6 first changes provider registration keys after wp3, wp4 consumes the final names, and wp5 proves remote dispatch with `mcp__goat__goat_*`.

Suggested 000_plan amendment (D5 clarification, not an added scope): state that legacy aliases are **presentation/identity-recovery only**, `T3_MCP_TOOL_NAMES` includes them for read-side ACP history, `resolveT3McpToolId` preserves original identity, the historical `t3_thread_start` stays read-side only, and provider-qualified names keep `t3-code` only during wp3; wp6 runs immediately after wp3 and before wp4/wp5, and wp5 probes the final `mcp__goat__goat_*` names. Also state that fresh provider sessions / matching GOAT remote versions are required; no callable old-name fallback is promised.

## Plan-writer evidence

- Only this document was written. Source inventory and hunks were derived in memory from source bytes and cross-checked against the exact name list; no source writes or git operations occurred. Read-only document consistency validation matched all 218 before-hunks in 54 files against current source bytes and reconstructed exactly 42 renamed declarations plus 84 intentional legacy alias/test lines in memory.
- Existing policy, Effect service conventions, 000 D1–D9 and 001 were read. All three memory stores were selectively cross-checked; older architecture context supplied no current rename authority or naming fact. Current source and the parent's decisions own this plan.
- Patch application, tests, typechecks, runtime initialization, independent review and remote dispatch remain **NOT RUN** by this leaf. Commands above are future parent gates, not claimed evidence.

## Post-review amendment (cycle 2)

Stale-name gate exceptions now also allow the intentional legacy rewrite in apps/server/src/orchestration-v2/ContextHandoffDelivery.ts (refreshRecoveryToolName + comment) and its regression fixture/assertion in apps/server/src/orchestration-v2/ContextHandoffBudget.test.ts. Any other t3_thread_read occurrence outside the presentation files still fails the gate.
