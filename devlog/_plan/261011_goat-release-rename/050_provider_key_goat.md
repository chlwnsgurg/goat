# 050 — wp6: provider MCP registration key `goat`

> **Audit fold (cycle 3)** — OpenCode 2 hashes the original thread id whenever sanitization is lossy (`sanitized !== threadId`) OR the prefixed name exceeds 64 characters. The exact 59-character collision pair (`thread:` + 49 `x` + `a:b` / `a_b`) now has a replay regression proving distinct HTTP registrations and symmetric removal. Existing lossy-id permission/test/fixture expectations are amended together; the own-thread wildcard overlap remains a pre-existing follow-up below. Source builds/tests were not run.

> **Stale check @f08a410af** — amended-hunk count: **11** (8 stale before-images, 3 line-position refreshes). The previous stale-check pass rechecked **182 hunks / 83 files** against the current wp2/wp3 source; cycle 3 refreshes the five existing OpenCode source/test/fixture diff blocks and revalidates all final hunk before-images read-only. Source builds/tests were not run.

## Loop spec

- Archetype: satisfy-spec, bounded provider integration work-phase. Parent owns all PABCD/FSM/loop/goal transitions and consultation; this leaf writes a plan only.
- Trigger: D6/A12 in `000_plan.md` and `002_architect.md`, after wp3 and before wp4, renames agent-visible MCP registration from `t3-code` to `goat`.
- Goal: new Codex, Cursor, Muse, ACP (including Grok/Antigravity), OpenCode 1/2, Pi and Claude sessions discover/call GOAT tools under the correct provider namespace, with unchanged credential/permission boundaries and readable old history.
- Non-goals: releases, CLI/archive/state-directory changes, env or npm/package renames, provider process restarts, browser/SSH execution, database rewrites, broad product rebranding, changing MCP wire tools owned by wp3, migrating saved Pi loadouts, installing dependencies, running builds/tests/servers during this plan-only delegation, source writes or git operations by this leaf.
- Verifier: focused commands in §6, all NOT RUN (explicit delegated restriction); source/config existence and hunk preimages inspected read-only. Runtime acceptance is registration + executable tool call, discovery/permission semantics, ACP origin precedence, OpenCode thread isolation and history rendering. Local source inspection is not PASS evidence for these behaviors.
- Stop: leaf stops after this complete single-file plan and handoff. Parent stops implementation when all focused gates pass on final integrated wp3/wp6 source and independent review passes, or records NEEDS_HUMAN for a policy/compatibility decision.
- Memory artifact: `devlog/_plan/261011_goat-release-rename/050_provider_key_goat.md`; parent places later command evidence in the existing unit evidence directory. This leaf creates no other artifacts.
- Outcomes: PLAN_WRITTEN (this delegation); implementation DONE (fresh gates/review), NEEDS_HUMAN (loadout/legacy-runtime compatibility decision), BLOCKED (missing toolchain). These are report dispositions, not new FSM states.
- Escalation: need for dual runtime registration, existing-process reload, broader identity migration, unplanned provider contract change, stale hunk ambiguity, or source outside the listed file map. Do not silently broaden scope.

## 1. Source and integration preconditions

Source root: `/Users/jun/Developer/new/700_projects/t3code-lanes/goat-release-rename`. Paths below are exact relative paths under this root, never under the plan checkout. Before-images were refreshed against current source on 2026-10-11; read-only `git rev-parse HEAD` returned `f08a410af0fa854b4c38fb7ed59bfc65424855c4`. This includes wp2 release/probe work at `fe8df0d3a` and wp3 bare MCP tools, GOAT server identity, shared aliases and ContextHandoffDelivery legacy rewriting at `f08a410af`. The original planning pass read `000_plan.md`, `001_inventory.md`, AGENTS.md and `docs/internals/effect-services.md`; this stale-check pass re-read every mapped source file and affected package test recipe. Existing wp3 source is now the authority for bare tool names.

All files are MODIFY; no source files are NEW or DELETE. The only actual leaf write is this plan. This is a diff specification against the inspected wp2/wp3 source at `f08a410af`, not proof that changes were applied. The refreshed hunks preserve toolkit renames, shared inventory aliases, CLI comments and docs. Claude keeps all current `goat_*` bare ids and changes their namespace to `mcp__goat__goat_*`; shared reader hunks retain `T3_MCP_TOOL_NAMES` and the complete legacy alias map. Recheck before-images if HEAD or mapped source bytes change again; do not undo wp3 when resolving context. A hunk failure requires a refreshed plan, not `--reject`, blanket replacements or forcing a patch.

The creation/serialization/consumption chain is: provider-local config object / ACP server list / Pi extension registration → SDK or ACP wire / OpenCode `mcp.add` → provider-qualified event names / ACP metadata → runtimeModel + shared presentation readers + Claude preapproval matching. Endpoint and token issuance are unchanged. This is a free string registration key, not a new enum or persisted field. Old history remains a reader concern. No new Effect service or transport logic is needed; adapters already own the registration boundary and helpers stay pure. Do not move ownership into ws.ts/HTTP/MCP handlers.

Consultation: inherited parent-owned `002_architect.md` process; no child spawn grant was supplied to this leaf and no consultation is claimed here. Parent must send the final integrated document to the same architect for reflection and then perform independent A review.

## 2. Ordered steps and decisions

Execution order (A12): **wp2 → wp3 → wp6 → wp4 → wp5**. wp6 runs after wp3 and before wp4. Complete its registration/allowlist/history changes before wp4 builds the runtime; wp5 then uses a fresh provider session to discover and call the final `mcp__goat__goat_*` names. The remote probe must not precede this cutover.

1. Revalidate wp3: all 42 renamed bare tools exist as `goat_*`; shared readers retain `t3_*` history aliases. Do not duplicate toolkit definitions. At `f08a410af`, source inspection cross-checked the planned 19 Claude read-only ids against the seven toolkit groups used by its existing annotation test: 15 have `mcp__goat__goat_*` names; `orchestrator_capabilities`, `list_scheduled_tasks`, `html_preview` and `html_render` retain their bare names under `mcp__goat__`. Run that test after implementation.
2. Extend shared reader namespace recognition with goat while retaining historical t3-code/t3_code/t3code spellings and icon/logo identifiers. This prerequisite prevents newly registered calls losing product/HTML presentation.
3. Update provider registrations: Codex config, Cursor/Muse SDK objects, shared ACP stdio + MCP-over-ACP lists and bridge serverId, OpenCode 1's isolated managed-server entry. With no provider-session credential, inject no MCP server. OpenCode external-server path stays externally owned.
4. Update ACP recovery prefix/suffix regexes, known-tool inventory matching and all origin guards together. Canonical GOAT recovery returns `server: "goat"`; explicit foreign raw/meta origins keep their identity. Unknown/path-like GOAT names stay generic. ACP Grok and Antigravity use this same adapter; their separate auth/probe/text-only clientInfo names are not registrations and do not need changing.
5. Update OpenCode 2 directory-level per-thread namespace to `goat-<thread>` only when sanitization is lossless and the prefixed name fits 64 characters. Use the existing SHA-256 first-16-hex digest of the raw id whenever `sanitized !== threadId` OR the prefixed name exceeds 64, independent of prefix length. Fold the exact `thread:` + 49 `x` + `a:b` / `a_b` regression into the existing HTTP replay harness, checking distinct registered names, scoped credentials and same-name removal. Update existing lossy-id permission expectations (including forks and adapted replay fixtures) to their raw-id digest names. Deny legacy `t3-code-*` AND current `goat-*`, then allow `${ownServer}_*`. Rules remain after broad runtime grants and agent path rules so the last matching rule preserves isolation. Keep register/remove symmetry and fork-specific credentials. Update app-owned instruction entry key to `goat` along with replay expectations; do not modify provider's unrelated settings.
6. Pi registers one `mcp__goat__<bare-tool>` per catalog item on modern and legacy Pi. Do NOT map two prefixes onto the same name. Keep bridge registration before builtins, direct orchestration tools, optional deferred discovery, tree-loadout reconciliation, cancellation and request metadata. Saved loadouts/selectors with old qualified names must be edited by their owner; no write-side old aliases are added.
7. Claude registers `goat`, uses `mcp__goat__*` only for non-read-only sessions, and read-only allowlist uses `mcp__goat__goat_*` for renamed tools plus unchanged non-t3 tools. Leave symbolic export names and auth env unchanged. Existing explicit allowlists are not rewritten automatically. Annotation cross-check must pass; never replace read-only list with a wildcard.
8. Correct the existing provider/user instruction strings and documentation. Preserve wrapper/context keys such as `t3_code_instructions` and `t3_code_orchestration` (they are application context identifiers, not registrations). Adapt replay fixture inputs explicitly as below; record them as adapted fixtures, not fresh captures.
9. Run §6 focused commands after implementation, inspect the allowed leftovers, request final independent review, and record exact evidence in the parent's unit. Hand the verified namespace to wp4 before the wp5 probe of final `mcp__goat__goat_*` names. No live service restart is required or authorized by this document.

Compatibility decision: D6 is a fresh-session registration cutover. Legacy namespace recognition (`t3-code`, `t3_code`, `t3code`) and bare `t3_*` aliases remain exclusively on the read side for history/presentation; no legacy namespace is registered, approved, or exposed as an executable alias. The OpenCode legacy deny rule is a rejection boundary, not a compatibility registration. Existing ContextHandoffDelivery legacy rewriting from wp3 is preserved. An old active provider process or Pi loadout can still address the old key; do not claim live migration. OpenCode old entries are denied rather than reused. ACP explicit legacy origins can still be projected as foreign MCP identity; shared readers render historical qualified names. Bare ACP fallback identity becomes goat because the app owns that bridge invocation.

## Residual (pre-existing, out of scope)

The own-thread allow wildcard `goat-thread_<id>_*` can also match a foreign thread whose readable id extends the owner's id with `_`: for lossless ids `thread_owner` and `thread_owner_child`, `goat-thread_owner_*` also matches tools under `goat-thread_owner_child`. This overlap already exists under `t3-code`; a prefix rename did not create it. Hashing lossy ids fixes the cycle-3 registration collision but does not establish universal wildcard isolation for lossless readable ids (nor remove every digest/readable namespace edge case). Keep this as a follow-up owned by the parent; do not change wildcard rules, namespace encoding or permission semantics in this unit. Register/remove symmetry and this residual must remain explicit in independent review; do not claim that fixing the collision resolves this separate permission issue.

## 4. Observable tests and conditional activation

| Scenario / activation | Required observable result | Owning tests |
|---|---|---|
| Codex startup/resume/fork with a scoped MCP session | config contains only goat; same endpoint/header; projected GOAT calls remain product tools | CodexAdapterV2.test.ts |
| Cursor/Muse scoped session | SDK options contain goat with existing authorization; absence path does not inject tools | provider-cursor / provider-muse adapter.test.ts |
| Generic ACP, Grok, Antigravity through shared ACP adapter | stdio name and advertised MCP-over-ACP serverId both goat; transport selection/fallback unchanged | AcpAdapterV2.test.ts; AcpJsonRpcConnection.test.ts |
| MCP-over-ACP connect goat / old key / foreign key | goat can message/disconnect; old/foreign rejected with typed bridge error before HTTP | mcpOverAcpBridge.test.ts |
| ACP wire titles (prefix, suffix, separators, bare), rewritten/titleless updates, qwen/goose origins | known tools recover goat; explicit foreign origin wins; unknown/path-like names remain generic; fallback JSON input retained | runtimeModel.test.ts |
| OpenCode 1 managed/external server, credential present/absent | actual openSession emits goat mcp.add with scoped credential only on owned server | provider-opencode/src/server/adapter.test.ts |
| OpenCode 2 resumed/forked full-access/approval/plan session | outbound permissions deny both namespaces then allow only own goat server; registration/removal uses same name and credential | OpenCode2AdapterV2.test.ts; OpenCode2OrchestratorV2.integration.test.ts |
| OpenCode lossless id length 59 / 60, lossy ids that fit and distinct long ids | Lossless 59-character id stays readable at 64 characters; 60-character or lossy id uses deterministic 21-character raw-id digest; long ids stay distinct | OpenCode2AdapterV2.test.ts |
| OpenCode exact pair `thread:` + 49 `x` + `a:b` / `a_b` (both 59 characters) | Same-directory HTTP replay registers distinct `goat-a8a5047e3b3ef95f` / `goat-84c3953c7ac1e4ef` with own credentials; unload removes each same name | OpenCode2AdapterV2.test.ts (existing HTTP replay harness) |
| Pi modern builtin search, absent/disabled/excluded builtin search, tree loadout | one register attempt per item initially, no hidden shadow, correct direct/deferred exposure, excluded calls remain excluded | mcpExtensionSource.test.ts |
| Pi execute and approval-required tool call | original catalog name sent over HTTP, abort signal forwarded, details.server goat, discovery remains read-only while tool still prompts | mcpExtensionSource.test.ts |
| Claude full-access vs read-only session, explicit/no allowlist, credential rotation | wildcard only in non-read-only policy; read-only list exactly matches toolkit annotations under final namespace; credential stays out of process args/log projection | ClaudeAdapterV2.test.ts |
| Fresh goat qualified names and persisted t3-code aliases | same product presentation/HTML reference; foreign or unknown tools remain generic | shared presentation/htmlRender tests; provider-core presentation test |
| Edited Pi/Grok/Muse/OpenCode replay transcripts | deterministic replay consumes new warning/instruction/key/rule strings without changed scenario outcomes | focused replay integration/contract tests |

The added/updated assertions exercise generated Pi execution, actual adapter wire options, metadata recovery, public result presentation, permissions and name-limit behavior. No new static-render, callback-wiring or source-string prefix tests are added. Existing Pi materialization prefix string assertions are removed in favor of the execution test. No sleeps/polling are added; replay/effect tests retain their existing drain/terminal barriers.

## 5. Exact before/after hunks

Each `diff` block is a complete unified patch for its stated file, generated from literal inspected source lines. Context is intentionally small for fixtures (their records are real full NDJSON lines). No `...` placeholders truncate a hunk. Copy the blocks into a patch outside the worktree; parent may validate/apply them against the checked `f08a410af` bytes. Refresh earlier-phase overlaps if source moves again. The prose does not authorize this leaf to apply anything.

The stale check has refreshed before-images for the integrated wp3 source at `f08a410af`. This extracts every diff block into the parent's temporary directory and checks it without applying. Run only in the source worktree. On any preimage failure, amend this document first; do not force application. The final `git apply` is parent-owned source editing, not a branch/commit operation; this leaf never invokes it.

```sh
python3 - <<'PY_PATCH'
from pathlib import Path
import re, subprocess, tempfile
plan = Path('/Users/jun/Developer/new/700_projects/goat/devlog/_plan/261011_goat-release-rename/050_provider_key_goat.md')

### MODIFY `apps/server/src/orchestration-v2/testkit/fixtures/multi_turn/muse_transcript.ndjson`

Replay-derived fixture adaptation only: preserve command/event ids, timestamps and ordering; update application-owned MCP identity/instructions and dual deny rows. These are edited replay inputs, not newly captured provider evidence.

## 6. Exact verification commands (parent execution only)

All test/typecheck/lint commands below: NOT RUN by this leaf because the task explicitly forbids builds/tests/installs. Exit status: unavailable. Direct file arguments exist in the inspected source. Package tsconfig.json files exist and include `src` (effect-acp also includes `test`; apps/server also includes vite.config.ts/scripts/integration). The server uses its own test configuration and relative git setup. Config-less provider/shared packages explicitly select root vite.config.ts with `--dir .`, matching their package.json test recipes; its environment is node and its excludes do not exclude these files. Typecheck may follow imported workspace dependencies; commands target these affected packages, not the repository recursively. `vp check`, `vp run -r test`, and `vp run -r typecheck` are prohibited.

After wp3/wp6 integration, run each test block from its owning package with package-relative paths as in 020. Reset to the source root for targeted typechecks, lint and later stale-name gates:

The replay `-t` filter observes exactly the affected four provider families; the source test title is `runs %s/%s through OrchestratorV2 using deterministic replay`. It is an affected fixture gate, not a substitute broad local suite. If test collection skips/matches zero relevant cases, record NOT OBSERVED and correct the filter; do not report a green command alone as coverage. Other unchanged provider scenarios are owned by CI. OpenCode 1 now exercises the actual `openSession` boundary with managed/external/credential-absent cases and exact `mcp.add` output. Its test helper adds an explicit `external` option, defaulting to the original external behavior for every existing test. An additional live external-server check is not authorized here.

Stale-name gates below are read-only and exact. Expected-empty searches use rg exit 1 as success, exit 0 as stale-name failure, and exit >=2 as tool error. Do not use `|| true` to hide an error. Each invocation must exit 0; stop on the first nonzero result. The function distinguishes an empty match from stale output and tool errors:

```sh
expect_empty() {
  if rg "$@"; then
    return 1
  else
    result=$?
    [ "$result" -eq 1 ]
  fi
}
expect_empty -n 'mcp__t3[-_]code__|"t3-code":|server: "t3-code"|name: "t3-code"' \
  apps/server/src/orchestration-v2/Adapters/CodexAdapterV2.ts \

  packages/provider-cursor/src/server/adapter.ts \
  packages/provider-muse/src/server/adapter.ts \
  packages/provider-opencode/src/server/adapter.ts \
  packages/provider-pi/src/server/mcpExtensionSource.ts
expect_empty -n '"t3-code"' packages/provider-acp/src/server/mcpOverAcpBridge.ts
expect_empty -n '^\s*name: "t3-code"|serverId: "t3-code"' packages/provider-acp/src/server/adapter.ts
expect_empty -n 't3-code|t3\[-_ \]\?code|mcp__t3[-_]code__|server: "t3-code"' packages/provider-acp/src/server/runtimeModel.ts
expect_empty -n 't3-code|mcp__t3_code__' \

  apps/server/src/orchestration-v2/testkit/fixtures --glob '*_transcript.ndjson'
```

Expected allowed output, inspect exact lines rather than requiring a blanket empty `rg t3-code`:

```sh
rg -n 't3-code|t3\[-_ \]\?code|mcp__t3_code__' \
  packages/provider-opencode/src/server/v2/adapter.ts \
  packages/provider-acp/src/server/adapter.ts \
  packages/shared/src/t3McpToolPresentation.ts \
  docs/orchestration-v2/orchestrator-mcp-server.md \
  docs/internals/providers.md
```

Allowed: OpenCode old-namespace deny row only; ACP `clientInfo: { name: "t3-code", version: "0.0.0" }` only; shared read aliases/regex alternatives/comments and unchanged t3-code logo/icon types/defaults/result; docs' explicit legacy history/loadout and legacy deny explanation only. New registration examples must say goat. For Pi, no `mcp__t3_code__` alias or hidden exposure may remain in the generated registration path. The only remaining old prefix in the new Pi test should be none; old-prefix materialization string tests were removed.

The broad audit identifies excluded identities and preserved compatibility fixtures:

```sh
rg -n 't3-code|mcp__t3_code__' packages apps/server docs \
  --glob '!**/node_modules/**' --glob '!*.ndjson' --max-columns 220 --max-columns-preview
```

Allowed groups: shared/client-runtime/history/asset/projection fixtures; t3-code logo/icon ids; mobile palette; `t3-codex-*` temporary-directory names; clientInfo auth/probe/setup/text helper names in ACP/Grok/Antigravity/effect-acp; MCP Apps hostInfo; relay audience/tunnel/observability identities; upstream installer/store links. None are active GOAT MCP registrations. Do not globally replace these. Inspect every unexpected residual active-registration hit and amend the map before implementation.

Fixture JSON syntax gate (parent runs after applying, no source writes):

```sh
python3 - <<'PY_FIXTURE'
from pathlib import Path
import json
root = Path('apps/server/src/orchestration-v2/testkit/fixtures')
for file in root.rglob('*_transcript.ndjson'):
    for line in file.read_text().splitlines():
        if line.strip():
            json.loads(line)
print('all provider transcript records decode')
PY_FIXTURE
```

This syntax check observes changed NDJSON paths but cannot prove behavior. Replay is the behavioral gate. Parent records command, exit code, observed tests and integrated source revision. No runtime PASS or hosted CI claim is made by this plan.

## 7. Risks, rollback and remaining judgments

- Pi duplicate-name risk is resolved by deleting the inner alias loop and checking actual registration attempts before mock deduplication. Re-registering once on exposure changes remains intentional. Old saved loadouts/selectors will need their owner's edit; report this as a cutover compatibility limitation rather than a silent migration.
- ACP relaxed separators must stay gated by known tool ids; all origin checks change atomically with regexes. Preserve foreign metadata precedence and generic foreign MCP projection. D5's known-tool inventory update must land before `goat_thread_send` recovery tests run.
- OpenCode reused daemons retain old directory registrations. Denying both namespaces before own-thread allow prevents broad full-access grants from reopening old names. Removal addresses only the newly owned goat registration; no unsolicited deletion/restart of old shared daemon state. A provider choosing an old name receives a denial and needs a fresh session/user-managed reload.
- Claude namespace and bare-name mismatch can deny legitimate reads or accidentally widen read-only access. Annotation cross-check is mandatory after wp3; wildcard remains confined to non-read-only policy. Keep auth token indirection, timeout and log redaction unchanged.
- Shared resolver changes must keep old history and HTML attachments readable. Namespace recognition does not execute aliases; unknown/foreign tool ids stay generic. Logo/icon identifiers remain unchanged.
- Fixture edits only adapt the product-owned strings and permission namespace. They are not measured native harness captures. Focused replay plus independent review is required; native CLI normalization behavior is an unmeasured runtime integration risk until separately authorized/verified.
- Earlier-phase overlapping hunks (Claude tools, instructions, shared reader and docs) were refreshed against wp3 at `f08a410af`. Revalidate if HEAD or mapped source changes before B. Do not apply an original-baseline patch over earlier phases.

Rollback: parent reverts only wp6 adapter keys/namespace parsing/rules/Pi registration/instruction/doc/fixture deltas as one coherent slice. Preserve wp2 release acquisition and wp3 `goat_*` bare tools/shared bare-tool aliases. If rollback occurs after later wp4 work, preserve its executable/archive changes too. Restore previous legacy deny rules with the matching registration namespace; never leave a goat registration with a t3-only allowlist or vice versa. Leave database history, live installs and runtime processes untouched. If the parent creates a distinct wp6 commit, a parent-controlled revert is simplest; this leaf performs no git operation. Old active sessions still require owner-managed reload to adopt either direction.

Recommended `000_plan.md` D6 amendment: define a fresh-session cutover to goat only, with read-side legacy aliases; Pi public/normalized names coincide and therefore get one registration (old saved loadouts are a stated limitation); OpenCode denies retired t3-code directory entries as well as goat entries; Claude read-only ids combine D5 and D6. Replace “36 extra files” with the enumerated file map/actual count, including fixture adaptations and shared reader companions. Use the accepted A12 order wp2 → wp3 → wp6 → wp4 → wp5: wp6 runs after wp3 and before wp4, and wp5 probes final `mcp__goat__goat_*` names.

Plan map totals: 83 MODIFY files (42 replay NDJSON files); 0 NEW, 0 DELETE. Exact diffs refreshed from inspected `f08a410af` before-images; no source edits or backend verifier execution occurred in this delegation.

Artifact validation @f08a410af: all 83 diff blocks / 182 hunks were decoded in memory; every context/removal line matched the read-only source at its refreshed hunk position, both old/new hunk line counts and cumulative new-file offsets matched, and all 42 planned NDJSON after-images parsed as JSON. Eleven original hunks were amended: eight stale-content hunks (orchestrationInstructions ×2, runtimeModel test ×1, Claude allowlist ×1, Codex tests ×3, shared resolver ×1) and three line-position hunks (shared resolver comment ×1, shared presentation tests ×2). Docs before-images already match wp3 and require no stale amendment. The 19 Claude allowlist after-image ids match current read-only toolkit annotations by source inspection; the annotation test remains NOT RUN. All 11 test commands are package-directory recipes confirmed against package.json, with existing package-relative file arguments. No patch was applied; no source test/build/typecheck/lint or backend verifier was run.

## Audit fold 2 (cycle 3)
Readable OpenCode server names keep the baseline 56-character id ceiling in addition to the lossy-sanitization guard (hunk above). Add regression: owner id = "thread_" + 49×"x" (56 chars) stays readable; child id = owner + "_b" (58 chars) is digested, so the owner's `goat-<owner>_*` allow rule does not match the child's tools (assert via the permission evaluation used by the adapter tests, not only the rule array). Wildcard overlap for ids ≤ 56 remains the pre-existing residual.
