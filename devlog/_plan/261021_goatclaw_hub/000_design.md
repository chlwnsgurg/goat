## 0. What this is

The user configures one device, the **hub**, and runs the whole fleet from it. The hub holds GOAT plus the
goatclaw supervisor, OpenCodex with the account pool, and every provider sign-in, including the
service-bound ones (Claude Cloud, Cursor Cloud, Devin Cloud). Other devices connect over SSH and hold
no provider sign-ins: their model traffic goes through the hub's OpenCodex, and their cloud launches
are routed to the hub as credential holder.

The design adds as little as it can, because most of the machinery exists:

Per the supervisor's correction, **this design builds no new routing or token system.** GOAT drives
OpenCodex's own Remote Link and Hub flows over the SSH connections it already has, observes the result,
and consumes the Home's pool and quota. [ADR-0021](../../../structure/decisions/ADR-0021-goatclaw-hub.md) is
the authoritative record. It supersedes the earlier supervisor decision D14 (OpenCodex Hub + Remote Link as
GOAT's default proxy path; OpenCodex Remote Workspace experimental for remote execution), whose documents
were uncommitted local notes and no longer exist. The D14 in `devlog/_plan/261013_remove-t3-internals` is an
unrelated dead-code rule.

**Hub-agnostic, hub decided.** The user chose (DH1): the hub stays on **jun's MacBook Pro**, the current Remote
Link Home, because it is nearly always on. Every package still works with any hub, and switching remains a
consent-gated capability (§1.8, H7) with no migration planned. The MacBook Pro is a laptop that also runs the
user's own work, so it keeps `allowGoals: false`, the #676 pressure guard applies to it, and it gets no heavy lanes.

Real gaps remain and are what this design adds: one provider-neutral quota model (§3), Child parity
detection and repair (§1.4), Windows devices (§1.5), install/adopt (§5), version alignment (§6), Fleet
status for the Home and its devices (§4), and the goatclaw control layer (§7–8).

  G == "existing GOAT SSH" ==> GW
```

- **Hub**: one GOAT environment that is also the OpenCodex Home and, when Windows devices exist, an
  OpenCodex Hub (`runtimeRole: "hub"`). OpenCodex already supports a Home running in Hub mode.
- **Child**: a macOS or Linux device joined as an OpenCodex Remote Link Child. Codex keeps
  `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1` with no token; the local OpenCodex relays to the Home.
- **Hub client**: a device Remote Link cannot serve (Windows, password-only SSH), joined with
  `ocx connect https://<hub>.ts.net --pairing-code-stdin`. See §1.5.
- **Standalone**: any device not joined. Nothing changes for it.

A person chooses the hub once in Settings (§4). GOAT never elects one. One hub per fleet; a second
is refused while the first is advertised.

### 1.2 Current deployment (observed 2026-10-21)

The Home is **jun's MacBook Pro**: OpenCodex 2.89.0 on `127.0.0.1:10100`, `/healthz` ok with no `role` field (a
Home answers as standalone or Home). Its `~/.opencodex/link/links.json` holds five links, each with a live
`lnk_*.pid` tunnel sidecar:

| Link                   | Alias                    | Tunnel port | Added      | Child `/healthz`    | Notes                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lnk_51d15fa48b90b40e` | macmini-ts               | 54958       | 2026-10-11 | 2.83.0, role client | Child has `runtimeRole: "client"`, no `home-codex-settings.json`        |
| `lnk_107d479405ab56be` | lidge-ts                 | 42255       | 2026-10-11 | 2.83.0, role client |                                                                         |
| `lnk_781ccea3cdb84745` | mac-studio               | 54365       | 2026-10-11 | 2.86.0, role client | has `~/.opencodex/link/home-codex-settings.json`                        |
| `lnk_ac30f40bb6167a49` | mini (Windows, Git Bash) | 52889       | 2026-10-11 | unknown             | Remote Link refuses Windows; what this link does is H6's first question |
| `lnk_9cd79877777a0603` | clisu-oracle             | 40847       | 2026-10-19 | unknown             |                                                                         |

The MacBook Pro's `~/.ssh/config` carries the block "# OpenCodex Remote Link children over Tailscale (added
2026-10-11). # Direct Tailscale SSH keeps the Home's 15-second link admission well inside its deadline." with
`Host macmini-ts` (100.76.170.81, user junny) and `Host lidge-ts` (100.100.125.116, user lidgeai), both
`ServerAliveInterval 30` and `ServerAliveCountMax 6`. mac-studio is reached as `mac-studio` (juns-mac-studio), mini
as 100.114.42.89 (user super, Git Bash default shell). Noninteractive SSH needed the bundled or Desktop `ocx` to
win over PATH shims.

Two facts shape the design:

- **Where link state lives.** The link record and tunnel sidecar live on the Home. A Home-initiated Child has
  only its config (`runtimeRole: "client"` and its saved connection) plus, once a Home settings sync has applied,
  `~/.opencodex/link/home-codex-settings.json`. A Child with no `~/.opencodex/link/` directory is therefore normal
  and is not drift. A missing `home-codex-settings.json` means no Home settings sync has applied there yet; it
  fails P6 (§1.4), not P2. mac-studio is the reference for a healthy Child.
- **Version drift.** Home 2.89.0, Children 2.83.0 and 2.86.0. Connection-bound relay authentication and the
  management relay need matching protocol support on both sides, so drift is a first-class state in H1's
  inventory and in §6.

### 1.3 How GOAT joins a device

GOAT runs OpenCodex's own commands over its existing SSH session. It never reads, prints or stores a
link key or data key; OpenCodex moves them over SSH itself.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Unmanaged
  Unmanaged --> Detected: detect (section 5)
  Detected --> Installing: consent, no ocx
  Detected --> Ready: ocx at or above minimum, standalone on its port
  Installing --> Ready
  Ready --> Probing: hub runs ocx link probe alias
  Probing --> AwaitFingerprint: offered SHA256
  AwaitFingerprint --> Linking: matches GOAT pinned host key
  AwaitFingerprint --> NeedsHuman: mismatch or no pin
  Linking --> Verifying: ocx link add alias --expect-fingerprint
  Verifying --> Child: parity ok
  Verifying --> Degraded: parity fails
  Degraded --> Verifying: repair ladder
  Degraded --> NeedsHuman: ladder exhausted
  Child --> Leaving: person, or agent with hub.manage
  Leaving --> Ready: ocx link revoke on Home, ocx disconnect on Child
```

- **Fingerprint.** GOAT already pins SSH host keys for its hosts (ADR-0008, `packages/ssh/src/hostKey.ts`).
  The hub compares OpenCodex's offered fingerprint (`ocx link probe <alias> --json`) with GOAT's pin for the
  same alias and passes it as `--expect-fingerprint`. No pin or a mismatch becomes a decision-inbox item
  (§8.2). Nobody types a token.
- **Alias.** The Home runs SSH from its own `~/.ssh/config`. GOAT uses direct Tailscale aliases and refuses
  an alias whose `ssh -G` shows a ProxyJump chain, which is what hit the 15-second admission window.
- **Commands.** Hub side: `ocx link probe`, `ocx link add`, `ocx link status --json`,
  `ocx link reconnect --link-id`, `ocx link revoke --link-id`, and for Hub clients `ocx hub invite`. Device
  side over GOAT SSH: `ocx --version`, `ocx status --json`, `ocx connect status --json`, and only when
  repairing `ocx sync`, `ocx restart`, `ocx disconnect`. GOAT resolves `ocx` on a device in OpenCodex's
  `remoteOcxArgv` order (Desktop and system before PATH shims).
- **Provider wiring on the device.** Codex needs nothing new: it already targets `127.0.0.1:10100/v1`. GOAT
  sets the device's Codex instance to `modelRoute: "opencodex"` and `verifyEffectiveCodexRoute` proves it.
  Claude Code gets `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:10100` on the device's `claudeAgent` instance only,
  never on `claudeCloud` (its diagnosis reports `forbidden_environment` for that variable). OpenCode gets the
  provider entry OpenCodex's OpenCode guide writes, through OpenCodex's client config export.
- **Scope.** Remote Link keys are per Child and not model-scoped. Hub-mode data keys carry
  `allowedProviders` and `allowedModels`. A device that should reach only some providers joins as a Hub client.

### 1.4 Child parity: detect and repair

OpenCodex #6957 showed that "Connected" is not proof: a Child can relay inference while its Codex settings,
dashboard and CLI still describe the Child, and a Home apply did not restart the Child runtime. Catalog
equality is necessary but not enough. GOAT computes one **parity verdict** per device from evidence it can
read without changing anything:

| Check                | Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Fails when                                                                                           |

machine), `broken` (P1–P3 fail), `unproven` (only P4 unavailable). The verdict and failing check ids appear
in the Fleet hub row and in `goat_host_status`.

Repair ladder. Each step re-runs the verdict and stops at the first `ok`:

1. `ocx sync` on the device (P6, P7).
2. `ocx restart` on the device (P5). Only when no turn is running there; otherwise it defers like
   ADR-0019's idle check.
3. `ocx link reconnect --link-id` on the Home (tunnel failures in P2, P3).
4. Re-link (Home `ocx link revoke`, device `ocx disconnect`, join again). This goes through the decision
   inbox because routing is briefly gone.

Cadence: on join, after any OpenCodex update on either side, after a Home settings change GOAT notices,
and every 30 minutes on the existing Scheduler. Tests drive it with TestClock.

### 1.5 Windows plan (mini)

Remote Link refuses Windows (`remoteOcxArgv` exits 125, `remote_platform_unsupported`), and Remote
Workspace refuses Windows commands. Hub mode has Windows service code (`src/service/windows-*`) and
authenticates clients with a per-client data key over HTTPS, so:

1. **Now (H6).** First inspect the existing link `lnk_ac30f40bb6167a49` (mini, tunnel port 52889, live sidecar on
   the Home): what mini's `/healthz` and `ocx --version` report, whether a Child connection was ever saved
   there, and whether anything uses the tunnel. Remote Link refuses Windows, so the expected answer is a
   tunnel with no working Child; Git Bash may have let parts of the flow run. Reuse nothing that only half works:
   record the finding, revoke the dead link on the Home with `ocx link revoke --link-id` (an approved change,
   DH2), and then join mini as a Hub-mode client over the tailnet. The hub enables Hub mode with a data listener
   behind Tailscale Serve, following OpenCodex's documented recipe. GOAT runs `ocx hub invite` on the hub and
   feeds the one-use pairing code to `ocx connect … --pairing-code-stdin` on mini over GOAT SSH; the code is
   never stored.
2. **Gate.** Before calling it done, prove on mini that `ocx connect` works under the Windows service, the
   key lands in the owner-only `service-api-token`, and Codex on mini is served by the hub (P3, P4). What
   fails becomes OCX-5 work, and mini stays standalone with its own logins, shown that way in Fleet.
3. **Later (OCX-5).** Windows Remote Link Child support, if OpenCodex wants it. GOAT treats it as one more
   transport value.

Password-only SSH gets the same answer: a device GOAT reaches only by password joins as a Hub client.

### 1.6 Hub down

OpenCodex owns the fallback behavior and GOAT follows its terms. A Child returns a retryable `503` and sends
neither key nor request when its tunnel is not ready, and a joined link waits up to 15 s for the tunnel.
OpenCodex is adding **fallback off** (OCX-11): a Child never silently serves its local providers when the Home is
unreachable, and model, account and provider fallback chains can be turned off per scope. GOAT reads that
state; it never changes OpenCodex fallback settings.

GOAT's own policy sits on top and uses separate words, so the two never blur:

- **GOAT fallback** is the existing fallback chain (ADR-0018): it moves new GOAT work to another provider
  instance. `hub.devices[alias].localFallback` allows a hop to a local provider instance on that device
  (`modelRoute: "default"`) only when the device has its own sign-in for that provider, the person turned it
  on, and OpenCodex's fallback state for that scope does not forbid local providers. The hop gets a thread
  notice; running turns stay.
- Otherwise goal work on that device **pauses** (health condition `HubUnreachable`), people's own threads see
  OpenCodex's 503 as today, and one decision-inbox item goes to the supervisor with options: wait, or move the
  work to a named host with its own sign-in. Switching the hub is not offered as an automatic option.
- The Fleet hub row and Settings → Hub (H4) show OpenCodex's fallback state per device and scope (on, off,
  unknown when the Home predates OCX-11), next to GOAT's `localFallback` switch.
- Hub health reuses #676. Placement treats the hub as `allowGoals: false`, so heavy lanes go elsewhere and the
  hub only routes, orchestrates and holds cloud launches.

### 1.7 What cannot be centralized

### 1.8 Switching the hub

Moving the hub moves where every login and account lives, so it is a person's decision, made in Settings → Hub
and confirmed through a decision item. It never runs automatically. The flow keeps the old Home as the rollback
until the new one is proven:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Planned: person picks new hub, decision approved
  Planned --> Preparing: new hub detected, OpenCodex compatible, provider sign-ins done on new hub
  Preparing --> PoolMoving: per-account consent (OCX-4 export and import)
  PoolMoving --> Relinking: each Child joins the new Home; old link kept until the new one passes parity
  Relinking --> Verifying: parity ok on every device through the new Home
  Verifying --> Committed: person confirms; old Home links revoked, old Home kept standalone
  Relinking --> RolledBack: any device fails and the person chooses rollback
  Verifying --> RolledBack
  RolledBack --> [*]: devices stay on or return to the old Home
  Committed --> [*]
```

- A device is re-linked only after its new link passes parity; until then its old link stays live.
- Accounts are copied with consent and never deleted from the old Home by GOAT. The person removes them after
  commit, from OpenCodex.
- Cloud holder preference moves with the commit.
- The audit log records each step. The work package is H7.

## 2. Cloud and service-bound providers through the hub

The holder model already does the routing. The hub changes one default and adds one gate:

- `hub.cloudHolder: "hub"` makes the hub the preferred holder in `chooseHolder`, through the explicit
  preference that already exists. A `goat_cloud_launch` from any device goes to the hub through the existing
  routed launch, and the run is registered there.
- Fleet lists cloud runs under the hub row with the originating device and thread.
- **Billing.** An agent's cloud launch needs the `cloud.launch` capability (§8.1; only in the `owner`
  profile) **and** either a person's explicit request in the originating thread or an approved decision item.
  Boat keeps its reconfirmed `settings:write` gate and #663's rule.
- Holder down: the existing `unreachable` failure. No automatic switch to another holder, because that is a
  different paid account.

## 3. One provider-neutral quota model

### 3.1 The gap

- GOAT has `ServerProviderUsageWindow` (`id`, `kind: session | weekly | monthly | other`, `usedPercent`,
  `resetsAt`, `windowDurationMins`) and a pluggable `UsageLimitSources` whose only kind is `cliproxy`.
- OpenCodex holds far more per account: Codex pool `StoredAccountQuota` (5h, weekly, monthly, custom
  windows, credits, reset credits) and `ProviderQuota` for Anthropic (5h, weekly, per-family windows with
  `scope: "model"`), Kiro credits, USD credits, Antigravity groups, Cursor, xAI, Kimi, Command Code and
  Devin. GOAT sees none of it; its only view is the active account's app-server rate-limit notification.
- "Codex shows one weekly window": GOAT's `codexRateLimitsToWindows` handles both positions, so the
  missing 5h window comes from what arrives over the OpenCodex route. OpenCodex's `src/routing/quota.ts`
  records a header parser that once filed 5h readings as weekly. Q0 reproduces this with a recorded frame
  before anyone fixes it.
- OpenCode reads only the OpenCode Go console key; everything else reports `unsupported`.

### 3.2 The model

One schema, produced by OpenCodex and consumed by GOAT.

```ts
// packages/contracts/src/quotaPool.ts (new); wire id "ocx.quota-pool/1"
type QuotaWindowKind = "burst_5h" | "daily" | "weekly" | "monthly" | "credits" | "custom";
type QuotaSource = "measured" | "header" | "estimated"; // probe body | response headers | derived

interface QuotaWindow {
  id: string; // stable per provider: "5h", "weekly", "custom:<label>", "family:opus"
  kind: QuotaWindowKind;
  label: string;
  usedPercent?: number; // 0..100
  used?: number;
  limit?: number;
  unit?: "requests" | "tokens" | "credits" | "usd";
  resetsAt?: string; // ISO
  windowSeconds?: number;
  scopeModel?: string; // only when the producer proved it (OpenCodex scope: "model")
  source: QuotaSource;
  observedAt: string;
  exhausted?: boolean; // producer's verdict, including refusal evidence
}

interface QuotaAccount {
  provider: string; // OpenCodex provider name: "openai", "anthropic", "cursor", ...
  driver?: string; // GOAT ProviderDriverKind when one maps
  accountRef: string; // stable hash; never an email or token
  label?: string; // masked label from OpenCodex's projection
  plan?: string;
  state: "available" | "exhausted" | "paused" | "reauth" | "unknown";
  windows: QuotaWindow[];
  failure?: string; // OpenCodex QuotaFailureCode
}

interface QuotaPool {
  schema: "ocx.quota-pool/1";
  producer: { version: string; role: "standalone" | "hub" | "client"; homeId: string };
  generatedAt: string;
  providers: Array<{
    provider: string;
    accounts: QuotaAccount[];
    pooled: { windows: QuotaWindow[]; headroom?: number; nextResetAt?: string };
  }>;
}
```

Rules: an absent window is unknown, never 0% (OpenCodex's rule). `pooled` is OpenCodex's own pool math
(`codexPoolQuotaEvidence` and its Anthropic counterpart); GOAT never re-derives it. A model-scoped window
never gates another model.

### 3.3 Producer: OpenCodex (brief OCX-1)

`GET /api/quota-pool` on the management API: a passive read assembled from caches that already exist (Codex
pool quota, provider account quota, Claude CLI usage admission), with no probe and no token refresh. Add it to
`LINK_MANAGEMENT_READ_PATHS` so a Child returns the Home's pool read-only, and to the Hub-client relay.
`?refresh=1` stays Home-local and admin-only. Breaking changes ship as `/2` while `/1` is still served for one
minor series.

### 3.4 Consumer: GOAT

- `UsageLimitSourceSnapshot.kind` becomes `Schema.Literals(["cliproxy", "opencodex"])`. Older clients drop
  the element through `ForwardCompatibleArray`.
- New `apps/server/src/usage/opencodexQuotaPool.ts` reads `/api/quota-pool` from the local OpenCodex: on the
  hub over loopback management with the admin token in `~/.opencodex/admin-api-token`; on a Child through its
  read-only relay. It maps to the new contract and to the existing window for older surfaces: `burst_5h` to
  `session`, `weekly` and `monthly` unchanged, the rest to `other`. `ServerProviderUsageWindow` gains optional
  `quotaKind`, `source` and `scopeModel` keys that old decoders ignore.
- `HostStatusMetrics` gains optional `quotaPool`. `goat_host_status`, `goat_scheduler_status`,
  `choosePlacement` and Fleet read it. Placement's "busiest window counts" rule runs over every window of the
  account, or over `pooled` when OpenCodex picks the account.
- Codex, Claude and OpenCode instances that route through OpenCodex show the pool windows of the provider they
  reach, labelled "via OpenCodex Home <name>", instead of one account's app-server reading.

## 4. GUI and agent surfaces

### 4.1 GUI

Web and desktop get the full surface; mobile gets read-only views plus the decision inbox.

- **Settings → Hub** (searchable, command palette entry):
  - "This machine is the hub" switch, with a preview of what it changes; cloud holder default.
  - Devices table: alias, transport (Remote Link Child, Hub client, standalone), parity verdict and failing
    checks, OpenCodex version verdict, last verified, and actions Join, Verify, Repair, Leave. Join and Leave
    need `settings:write`; Verify needs `orchestration:read`.
  - Per device: "use this device's own sign-in when the hub is down".
  - A link to the Home's OpenCodex dashboard for accounts and keys. GOAT never shows a key.
- **Fleet → hub row**: the Home and each device with transport, parity verdict, tunnel state from
  `ocx link status`, version verdict, OpenCodex fallback state (OCX-11, when available) and pressure (#676).
  Cloud runs sit under the hub.
- **Fleet → Pool**: per provider, every account's windows (5h, weekly, monthly, credits, model-scoped), pooled
  headroom, next reset, and a source badge (measured, header, estimated).
- **Decision inbox** (§8.2).

### 4.2 Agent tools (registry entries, ADR-0007 naming)

| Tool                                                              | Effect      | Needs                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `goat_hub_status`                                                 | read        | Home, devices, transports, parity, versions                          |
| `goat_quota_pool`                                                 | read        | the §3 pool, optional provider filter                                |
| `goat_hub_device_verify`                                          | read        | runs parity checks, no repair                                        |
| `goat_hub_device_repair`                                          | write       | ladder steps 1–3; `hub.manage`                                       |
| `goat_hub_device_join`, `goat_hub_device_leave`                   | write       | `hub.manage` plus an approved decision unless the profile is `owner` |
| `goat_decision_list`, `goat_decision_get`, `goat_decision_answer` | read, write | answering needs the profile the item names                           |
| `goat_permission_profile_get`                                     | read        | the caller's effective profile                                       |

Choosing a model by remaining window stays in `goat_host_status` with `placement` (#676), now scored against
the pool. Agents never pick an OpenCodex account: OpenCodex's pool selector owns accounts; GOAT picks provider,
model and host.

### 4.3 First run

Three separate prompts on the hub's desktop app, each shown once: **OpenCodex** (detect, adopt or install,
§5), **goatclaw** (enable the supervisor, pick a default profile, sign in to providers on the hub) and
**Computer use** (owned by the Cua manager, wording unchanged). They share #681's mechanism: its
`computerUsePrompt` (pending, enabled, later) becomes one key of a small `firstRunPrompts` client-setting
record. "Later" is remembered per prompt, and each has a Settings entry. The only thing shared with the Cua
manager is that record's shape; the toggles stay separate.

### 4.4 Settings ownership

`hub.*` lives in the hub's server settings: `hub.enabled`, `hub.cloudHolder`,
`hub.devices[alias].localFallback`, `hub.parityIntervalMs`. Devices store nothing new; their state is
OpenCodex's own files. Writes use `createEnvironmentRpcCommand` with new `CLIENT_GUARDED_RPC_SCOPES` entries
(`settings:write` for join, leave and enable; `orchestration:read` for status and verify).

## 5. Installing when OpenCodex already exists

Detection, read-only, locally or over SSH:

1. Running service: `GET 127.0.0.1:10100/healthz` (`service`, `role`, `version`), then the port configured in
   `~/.opencodex/config.json` or under `OPENCODEX_HOME`.
2. Binaries in OpenCodex's order: `~/.opencodex-desktop/bin/ocx`, `/Applications/OpenCodex.app/Contents/MacOS/ocx`,
   `/usr/bin/ocx`, then PATH with Bun, local and Homebrew directories; each must answer `--version`.
3. Installer ownership (bun, npm, pnpm, mise, source) from OpenCodex's own `install-detection.mjs` verdict,
   read through `ocx status --json`.
4. Service unit: `ocx service status --json` (launchd, systemd, Windows task).
5. Link and Hub state: `ocx link status --json`, `ocx connect status --json`.

| Mode                                               | When                                       | GOAT may                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **adopted** (default whenever an install is found) | the user's install exists                  | read; run link, connect, sync and status commands with consent; advise updates             |
| **managed**                                        | nothing found and the person chose Install | install with OpenCodex's documented installer (npm global or Desktop) and update it per §6 |
| side by side                                       | never by default                           | tests only, with a separate `OPENCODEX_HOME` and port; not offered in the UI               |

GOAT never writes `~/.opencodex`, Codex `config.toml` or any account store directly. Every change is an
`ocx` command or management API call that OpenCodex validates and backs up. Joining leaves the device's own
providers in place, labelled local and inactive, as OpenCodex already does.

Existing logins on a device stay. Moving accounts into the Home pool is optional and belongs to OpenCodex
(OCX-4): export and import over the link with per-account consent on the Home. Credentials never pass
through GOAT.

## 6. Update alignment

- **Compatibility is a verdict, as in ADR-0019.** OpenCodex already serves protocol numbers
  (`REMOTE_HUB_PROTOCOL`, `minimumClientProtocol`, `protocolVersion`, Remote Workspace RPC v2, connection-bound
  relay auth). OCX-3 fills `features` on `/readyz`. GOAT keeps one table, `packages/shared/src/opencodexCompat.ts`,
  with the minimum version and required features per GOAT capability. Per device: `compatible`, `degraded` (a
  feature missing, for example no pool, so the app-server windows show) or `incompatible` (below Remote Link
  2.66.0, or a relay-auth mismatch).
- **Who updates whom.** Managed installs move through GOAT's runtime update path under ADR-0019's rules: own
  channel only, staged bucket, idle-only activation, health check after restart (`/healthz` version and role,
  then P3), 10-minute probation, rollback to the previous pinned version, and no automatic retry of a
  rolled-back target. Adopted installs get an advisory notice and an Update button that runs `ocx update` only
  when the person clicks it.
- **Order.** Connection-bound relay auth needs Home and Child updated together. GOAT updates a linked pair in one
  idle window, Home first and then each Child, re-running parity after each. If any member is busy, the pair waits.
- **Version drift is a normal state.** Today: Home 2.89.0, Children 2.83.0 (macmini-ts, lidge-ts) and 2.86.0
  (mac-studio). H1 reports each device's version, protocol numbers and features, and the pair verdict. A pair is
  `compatible` when the Child's served protocols include what the Home requires (and the reverse), whatever the
  versions. Drift alone never triggers an update. When an update is wanted, the order is fixed: Home first,
  then each Child, in one idle window, re-running parity after each step. If the Home's new version would make a
  Child `incompatible`, the Children move in the same window or the Home waits. OCX-8 asks OpenCodex to state
  per release which Child versions a Home still serves.
- **Lessons from 10/21.** `fix/ssh-runtime-update-handling` is still in progress locally on the supervisor's side;
  U1 builds on it once it lands and does not reimplement it. The stated lessons are encoded directly: a
  compatible adopted OpenCodex is never replaced, and a managed one moves only when its own channel's target is
  eligible under ADR-0019, never because GOAT itself updated or a nightly appeared.

## 7. goatclaw orchestration model

A lane runs one of two ways:

- **(a) GOAT dispatch** (`delegate_task`, `goat_thread_launch`, `goat_ssh_thread_launch`): any provider, model and
  host; its own worktree; durable, visible in Fleet, and it outlives its parent.
- **(b) Provider-native subagents** (Codex `spawn_agent` v2, Claude Code Task): same provider and machine, the
  parent's sandbox and history, cheapest to start.

| many short parallel probes sharing the parent's context             | (b): a Codex v2 fork with `preserve_fork_prefix`, which keeps the prompt cache |

Codex multi-agent v2 at af91f6ef2c offers `spawn_agent` v2 (`fork_mode: FullHistory`; model overrides when
`expose_spawn_agent_model_overrides`), `preserve_fork_prefix` (default true), `max_concurrent_threads_per_session`,
`subagent_thread_environments` and `runtime_agent_instances` (both under development and off by default), and a
remote message board (`message_board_remote` with a URL and bearer env var). goatclaw sets
`max_concurrent_threads_per_session` from the profile and leaves under-development features off until Codex marks
them beta; O3 enables `subagent_thread_environments` then.

**Lane types.** `LaneKind` in contracts: `research`, `implement`, `review`, `verify`, `merge`, `sweep`. A lane
carries `profile`, `host`, provider and model, `mode: "dispatch" | "native"`, `parent` and `reportTo`.

**One policy for both.** A profile (§8.1) sets the runtime-mode ceiling GOAT already enforces for (a), and the
provider settings for (b): Codex `multi_agent_v2.max_concurrent_threads_per_session`, Claude Code max turns and
allowed tools. GOAT already sees native subagents (the Codex adapter maps collab tool calls and child threads;
Claude Task arrives as tool calls). O2 shows them in Fleet under their parent with `mode: native` and counts them
against the profile's `maxLanes`.

**Reports.** Each lane ends with `goat_thread_report_result` (a) or its native result (b), which the parent folds
into its own report. Managers report to the supervisor with `goat_origin_report`. Questions become decision items.

## 8. goatclaw core

### 8.1 Permission profiles

Named and stored on the server; every launch path reads them. A profile only narrows what the caller already
holds (ADR-0016: no new authority).

```ts
interface PermissionProfile {
  id: string; // built-ins: observer, worker, manager, merge-manager, owner
  runtimeModeCeiling: RuntimeMode;
  capabilities: Array<
    | "threads.launch"
    | "threads.remote"
    | "worktree.create"
    | "pr.open"
    | "pr.merge"
    | "hub.manage"
    | "cloud.launch"
    | "boat.start"
    | "settings.write"
    | "goals.apply"
  >;
  hosts?: string[]; // allowlist; absent means every connected host
  maxLanes: number; // running lanes, native subagents included
  maxTurns?: number;
  maxWallClockMs?: number;
}
```

Built-ins: `observer` (read only); `worker` (launch, worktree, open PRs, 3 lanes); `manager` (adds remote
launch and goals, 6 lanes); `merge-manager` (manager plus `pr.merge`, which squashes only PRs whose exact head has
a green `goat-ci-result`, that are not `CONFLICTING` (behind `dev` is fine, see
[merging](../../../docs/operations/merging.md)), and that have no changes requested); `owner` (everything).
`cloud.launch` and `boat.start` are only in `owner`. Checked at
claim time and again on every action, as ADR-0016 does.

### 8.2 Decision inbox

A durable table on the hub, `decision_items`: `id`, `from` (thread, host), `title`, `context`, `options` (id,
label, consequence), `recommended`, `requiredProfile`, `expiresAt`, `status` (open, answered, expired, withdrawn),
`answer`, `answeredBy`. It is answered from GUI, mobile, or an agent with `requiredProfile`. Pending GOAT
questions (`goat_pending_request_*`) appear as items too, so a person sees one inbox. An answer becomes a message
to the asking thread. Silence never approves: expiry withdraws the item.

### 8.3 Role templates

Launch presets of prompt preamble, profile and report protocol:

- **supervisor**: reads, plans and asks; holds `owner` but delegates writes.
- **domain manager**: `manager`; owns one goal.
- **merge manager**: `merge-manager`; one PR at a time, green CI, no changes requested; stops on a dev CI failure.
- **issue sweeper**: `worker`; triage and small fixes.

The report protocol is the same for all: `progress` at milestones, `completed` or `failed` with a short factual
summary, and `needs_input` through the decision inbox.

### 8.4 GOAT Bot

With goatclaw on, GOAT Bot fronts the supervisor. It stays read-only by instruction (#660) and places lanes per
#663; authority lives in the managers it launches under their profiles. Turning goatclaw off returns the bot to
front-desk mode and stops new manager launches; running managers finish. goatclaw is opt-in at first run (§4.3)
with the profile caps above.

## 9. Security and privacy

- **No credentials on non-hub devices** is OpenCodex's existing guarantee. A Child holds a link key inside
  OpenCodex and strips caller credentials; a Hub client holds one data key in an owner-only file. GOAT adds no
  token and never reads, logs or relays either key. Rotation and revocation stay OpenCodex's
  (`ocx connect rotate`, `ocx link revoke`, Home dashboard API keys); GOAT's buttons run those commands.
- **The management relay stays authenticated and read-only by default.** GOAT reads the Home through a Child's
  passive relay, and talks to the Home's management API only on the hub, over loopback, with the admin token. The
  only relay addition GOAT asks for is the quota pool read (OCX-1).
- **Local trust.** Any program on a Child that reaches `127.0.0.1:10100` uses the Home. That is OpenCodex's
  documented model, and it becomes fleet-wide, so the Settings preview says so.
- **Audit log.** One append-only `audit_events` table on the hub covering join, leave, repair, rotate, revoke,
  cloud launch, merge, profile change and decision answers: time, actor, profile, action, target, outcome,
  decision id. No secrets. Readable through `goat_hub_status` and Settings.
- **Provider terms, flagged and not decided.** Pooling personal subscriptions across devices may conflict with a
  provider's terms. The Hub settings preview says so and the person decides. The brief says Claude is mostly
  allowed to be routed; this design does not verify that.

## 10. Work packages

Q0 and H1 come first because they gather evidence. Contracts come next, then services, then UI. Every GOAT test
is deterministic: `it.effect` with TestClock, recorded OpenCodex JSON fixtures, no sleeps and no live OpenCodex.

jun's MacBook Pro (the current Home) gets no packages and cursor2 is skipped. Every package is hub-agnostic: the hub is whichever environment has `hub.enabled`, and tests run each flow against a non-local Home. Merging follows the dependency column, one PR at a
time, squash, green goat-ci. Batches for the nightly: (1) Q1, D1, H1, Q0; (2) Q2, H2, H3, D2, C1, O1;
(3) H4, H5, H6, O2, O3, D3; (4) F1, U1, H7. After each batch merges, the supervisor is told so the merge manager can
publish through the nightly channel.

### OpenCodex package briefs (for the OpenCodex manager on mac-studio)

- **OCX-1 `GET /api/quota-pool`.** A passive read assembling §3.2 from existing caches (Codex pool
  `StoredAccountQuota`, per-account `ProviderQuota`, Claude CLI usage admission, Kiro and USD credits, Antigravity
  groups). No probe, refresh or token refresh. Add it to `LINK_MANAGEMENT_READ_PATHS` and the Hub-client relay.
  `accountRef` is a stable hash, never an email. Tests: the passive-read guard in the style of
  `tests/server/link-management-relay.test.ts`, a shape snapshot, absent-not-zero.
- **OCX-2 served-by header.** Relayed and Hub-served responses carry `x-opencodex-served-by` with the Home's stable
  instance id (not a hostname), so GOAT can prove P4 without reading logs.
- **OCX-3 `/readyz` features.** Fill `features` with `quota-pool/1`, `link-management-relay`, `served-by-header` and
  the relay-auth version, so peers decide compatibility without parsing versions.
- **OCX-4 Child-to-Home account move.** Optional, per-account consent on the Home dashboard, over the link and never
  through another program. The Child keeps its copy until the person removes it.
- **OCX-5 Windows.** First confirm Hub-mode clients on Windows (service plus `ocx connect`) and fix what H6's gate
  finds. Then, if wanted, a Windows Remote Link Child.
- **OCX-6 parity on apply.** Close what remains of #6957: after a Home apply, restart the Child runtime and record
  the apply time so a peer can compare it with the Child's start (P5); expose the applied codex-settings digest in
  `ocx status --json` (P6).
- **OCX-7 header parser.** If Q0 confirms it, stop filing 5h readings as weekly on the routed path.
- **OCX-8 linked-pair versions.** The fleet runs Home 2.89.0 with Children on 2.83.0 and 2.86.0. Publish, per release,
  the Child versions a Home still serves and the reverse (relay auth, management relay, link protocol), expose them
  in `/readyz` `features` or protocol numbers, and make `ocx link status --json` on the Home report each Child's
  version and a compatibility verdict, so drift is visible without SSH to every Child.
- **OCX-9 the mini link.** The Home has a live link `lnk_ac30f40bb6167a49` to mini (Windows, Git Bash) although
  Remote Link refuses Windows. Find out how it was created, what its tunnel serves, and make `ocx link add` refuse a
  Windows Child before issuing a key and starting a tunnel. Clean up such records with a clear message.

- **OCX-11 fallback off (OpenCodex's own package).** GOAT consumes it: expose per-scope fallback state read-only
  (management API and the Child relay) so H4/H5 can show it and respect it.
- **OCX-10 service status JSON.** `ocx service status --json` with `{installed, running, backend}`, and the
  install-detection verdict in `ocx status --json` (found by H1).
- **OCX-7** is dropped: Q0 (#687) showed the weekly-only reading is the locally signed-in account, not a parser bug.

## 12. Rollout

Everything sits behind `hub.enabled` and `goatclaw.enabled`, both false by default. With both off no new timer runs
and nothing changes, except the read-only inventory (H1), which runs only while Settings → Hub is open. Mixed
versions: older GOAT hosts show `degraded` in the hub table, and older OpenCodex installs show the app-server windows
they show today.
