# Connection runtime

Web, the desktop renderer, and mobile share one connection owner per environment
in `packages/client-runtime`. Platform code supplies storage, credentials, network
signals, and application lifecycle events. React views consume the runtime.
Keeping retries and session lifetime here prevents competing reconnect loops when
several views need the same environment.

## One transport retry owner

The [supervisor](../../packages/client-runtime/src/connection/supervisor.ts) owns
transport retry policy; resolving an endpoint and opening an RPC session are single
attempts. Transient failures retry with jittered exponential backoff, capped at
five minutes, that resets only after a connection stays up. Without jitter, every
client of a restarted server reconnects in the same second; with a short cap, a
client that can never connect retries all day. Offline states and authentication
failures wait for a wakeup instead of spending attempts on unchanged conditions.

Foregrounding, an explicit retry, and an offline report probe the established
session, and only a failed probe reconnects. Offline reports are often wrong, for
example for a loopback server. A long suspension is the one exception: a long
mobile background, or a desktop that slept (the main process forwards
powerMonitor `resume`, since a closed lid may never change page visibility).
It replaces the session at once, because the OS can kill a socket without
reporting closure, and a probe would hold a dead socket in "Resuming" until it
times out. That fresh attempt runs even while the network reports offline. On
desktop an SSH forward can outlive its dead TCP connection for ssh's 45 s
keepalive window, so a resume also closes forwards that stop answering.
Foregrounding also wakes a pending retry immediately and leaves an ordinary
in-flight attempt alone.

SSH connections classify their failures before they reach this loop, so a
sleeping host retries quietly and a rejected key waits for the user. See
[SSH reconnect](ssh-reconnect.md).

The [registry](../../packages/client-runtime/src/connection/registry.ts) scopes
connections by environment. An involuntary disconnect retains the registration
and cached data. Explicit removal closes the scope and clears credentials,
projections, and platform-owned state such as drafts. Cloud-account changes apply
to relay registrations; they must not discard directly paired environments.

## HTTP authorization

RPC sessions authenticate at socket upgrade, while HTTP requests need current
credentials from the
[authorization service](../../packages/client-runtime/src/authorization/service.ts).
Replacing a healthy socket for HTTP renewal would interrupt conversations and
change the transport generation without a transport failure. Credential expiry
does not close the socket, and refresh failure belongs to the HTTP operation.

Session listings must retain unrevoked connected sessions after credential expiry
so an open connection does not disappear from connection management. This does
not extend the credential's lifetime. New HTTP requests and socket upgrades still
require valid credentials.

## Transport health and data freshness are separate

A socket opening is insufficient evidence that the environment is usable. The
[RPC session](../../packages/client-runtime/src/rpc/session.ts) waits for the
initial server configuration before becoming ready. Shell and thread data then
have their own synchronization state. A failed shell subscription can coexist
with a healthy connection; labeling that state "reconnecting" promises a
transport retry that will never happen.

Cached projections remain readable offline. They must neither imply a live
connection nor overwrite newer live data during a reconnect. Loading and
resuming snapshots belongs to the shared state services, so every view agrees
on which data is current.

[Thread detail](../../packages/client-runtime/src/state/threads.ts) separates
subscription lifetime from cache lifetime. Mounted consumers share one live
stream, which stops when the last consumer unmounts; hidden mounted routes still
count. A registry-local cache retains state and its replay cursor for five idle
minutes so back navigation can resume without another snapshot download.

The desktop app adds one consumer: a
[keep-alive](../../apps/web/src/state/threads.ts) mounts every thread whose
session is starting or running, in each enabled environment. Opening a running
thread then needs no replay. The shell and detail streams are independent, so
the shell can report a stop before the detail loads or catches up. A stopped
thread stays mounted until its own stream is live and shows the stop, and the
stream then closes and saves the settled state.
Web and mobile do not keep threads alive.

Retain state and cursor together only after an update finishes. Cancellation must
not advance the cached cursor beyond the applied data, and an old scope must not
overwrite its successor's cache. Preserve pagination data on reuse, but clear
canceled loading state.

The [RPC boundary](../../packages/client-runtime/src/rpc/client.ts) resolves
requests against the current session at execution time. Durable subscriptions
follow replacement sessions. After a transport failure they wait for the
supervisor; an expected domain failure may resubscribe on the same healthy
session. Reconnection does not automatically replay mutations, whose retry and
idempotency rules belong to the operation.

## The saved connection catalog stays at schema version 1

Add new catalog state as optional keys, as `githubRoutingPermissions`, `disabledEnvironmentIds`
and `hub` were added, and never raise `schemaVersion`. A mobile build that cannot decode the
catalog deletes it and falls back to the legacy key
([catalog-store.ts](../../apps/mobile/src/connection/catalog-store.ts)), so one write of a newer
version followed by an over-the-air rollback would forget every saved server. Older builds that
rewrite the catalog drop keys they do not know; anything stored there, such as the phone's hub,
needs a fallback for its key disappearing.
