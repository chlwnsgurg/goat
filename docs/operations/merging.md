# Merging pull requests

This is the merge policy for goat-si/goat. A pull request lands when its own head is green.
Rebasing every pull request onto the latest `dev` throws away green CI and starts another run each
time `dev` moves, so it is not part of merging.

## When to rebase

Do not rebase or update the branch just because `dev` moved. Rebase only when GitHub reports the
pull request as `CONFLICTING`, or when its CI can pass only with a fix that exists only on `dev`.

## Merging one pull request

Squash-merge as soon as `goat-ci-result` is `SUCCESS` on the exact head commit:

```sh
gh pr merge <pr> --admin --squash --match-head-commit <head-sha>
```

`mergeStateStatus` `CLEAN` or `UNSTABLE` (behind `dev`) is fine. `--match-head-commit` makes the
merge fail if someone pushed after you read the checks. Read `goat-ci-result` only; it is the one
check that covers every selected task ([CI](../../structure/ci.md#when-goat-ci-runs)).

A failure that also happens identically on `dev` does not block the merge. Record it in the pull
request with a link to the matching `dev` run, then merge. Re-run jobs that failed from a flake or a
cancellation (`gh run rerun <run-id> --failed`) instead of rebasing.

Upstream chase merges are the exception. They land with a merge commit or a fast-forward so the
merge base with upstream moves forward ([chase rules](../../devlog/_chase/README.md)).

## Stacks

1. Merge the bottom pull request into `dev`. Deleting its branch makes GitHub retarget the next one
   to `dev`.
2. If the next head already has a successful `goat-ci-result`, merge it without rebasing.
3. Stacked pull requests often show no result, because goat-ci never ran fully on that head. Start
   one with `gh workflow run goat-ci.yml --ref <branch>`, or re-run the failed jobs, instead of
   rebasing.

## Merging many

Work through every green pull request one after another. Merges into `dev` start no CI on their
own, so after about every five merges run a full pass on `dev` (`gh workflow run goat-ci.yml --ref
dev`, which defaults to `lane=all`). Stop merging only if `dev` goes red, and resume once it is
green again.
