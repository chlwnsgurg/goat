# Cursor

Cursor V2 runs through the official [`@cursor/sdk`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/sdk/typescript)
TypeScript package. It does not use Cursor's ACP transport for V2 execution.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.13 or newer. The repository's supported Node version satisfies this requirement.
- Sign in with Cursor in **Settings > Providers > Cursor**, or provide a Cursor API key in
  `CURSOR_API_KEY`.
- A paid Cursor plan on the account used for browser sign-in or `CURSOR_API_KEY`.
- A model accepted by the Cursor SDK. `auto` is sent to the SDK as its `default` model selection.

The Cursor provider runs in the selected GOAT workspace. Cursor Cloud is a separate provider
that runs against the published repository in Cursor's cloud.

## Sign in

Choose **Sign in**, then open the sign-in page and complete it in your browser. GOAT
updates automatically when sign-in finishes. This works when connected to a remote environment too.
On mobile, use **Settings > Provider accounts** for an already configured Cursor instance.

Each provider instance keeps its own login on the environment that runs it. Your Cursor editor and
CLI login are separate. A configured `CURSOR_API_KEY` overrides browser sign-in; remove that override
to use the browser flow.

Use **Change account** or **Sign out** in the same settings section. Both stop that
instance's running threads and keep their history. Sign-out forgets the saved credential; to revoke
the generated key before it expires, remove it from your Cursor dashboard's API keys.

## Cursor Cloud

Cursor Cloud appears automatically in **Settings > Providers** and becomes available when you
sign in to Cursor. You can start sign-in from the Cursor Cloud card; it uses the Cursor account.
Turn Cursor Cloud off with its toggle. To follow Cursor's enabled state again, reset the cloud
card. For another account, add a custom Cursor Cloud instance and choose its Cursor source.
On mobile, manage the account under **Settings > Provider accounts**. Cursor Cloud uses only
the selected Cursor provider's sign-in or its `CURSOR_API_KEY`; when that provider is signed
out, Cursor Cloud is unavailable until you sign in again.

Select Cursor Cloud for a repository with a pushed branch. The first message starts
from the published revision; local edits and unpushed commits are not included.
Cloud messages accept text only and require full access. GOAT's sandbox and approval
overrides do not apply to Cursor's cloud. Progress, summary, and returned PR or branch
links remain visible when connecting to the environment remotely. Cursor may create
a draft PR; opening it does not mean its checks passed.

If Cursor stops a run with an unexpected error before it opens a branch or PR, GOAT asks the
same agent to continue once, and the thread shows the result of that retry. Errors you need to
fix, such as sign-in, access, or usage limits, are not retried.

Messages sent while a task is active wait for completion. Later messages continue
in the same cloud agent using its original repository revision, without including
subsequent local edits. **Stop** requests remote cancellation; GOAT marks cancellation
only after Cursor confirms it. Closing GOAT or changing the account detaches
observation; cloud work may continue. An unknown submission or tracking outcome
blocks further messages until reconciled; open the saved agent link to inspect it.

Manage sign-in from the Cursor Cloud card or the selected Cursor provider's settings on the
environment running the task. Cursor Cloud uses that provider's account.

## V2 Capability Mapping

The adapter supports:

- creating and resuming local Cursor agent threads;
- changing the model and model parameters between turns;
- assistant text, reasoning, tool activity, plans, and todo streaming;
- thread-scoped GOAT MCP tools;
- image attachments;
- interruption, queued app messages, and orchestrator-owned interrupt/restart steering;
- provider conversation snapshots through `Agent.messages.list()`;
- Cursor `task` subagents, projected as read-only child app threads with their tool activity and
  final result.

The public SDK does not currently expose native agent fork, conversation rollback, active steering,
or interactive approval callbacks. Direct active steering is advertised as unsupported, while V2
steering uses the orchestrator's interrupt-and-restart path and preserves the app run identity across
provider turns. Same-provider Cursor forks use the orchestrator's portable full-thread context
handoff into a fresh Cursor agent. The SDK has in-process custom callback tools, but the V2 adapter
intentionally uses the authenticated, thread-scoped MCP server instead.

Portable handoffs summarize eligible timeline items and can omit the end of long messages. Read
[Context in portable handoffs](./portable-handoffs.md) before using a fork for work whose exact
instructions must carry forward.

Cursor task events include an `agentId`, but the local SDK does not register that identifier as a
resumable agent: `Agent.resume()` returns `AgentNotFoundError`. The adapter therefore does not attach
a provider thread to native task projections or advertise subagent thread IDs. A projected child is
read-only: send messages from the parent thread.

Runtime modes map to the controls the local SDK exposes: full access disables its sandbox, while
restricted modes normally enable it. On Windows, Auto and Supervised run without filesystem
isolation when Cursor Auto-review is enabled, because the SDK does not support a filesystem sandbox
there. Restricted modes without Auto-review, including the default Auto-accept edits mode, still
request the sandbox and cannot start on Windows. Explicit sandbox policies remain authoritative,
including restrictive policies that the Windows SDK rejects. Explicit approval policy overrides
control Auto-review, which is not represented as an interactive GOAT approval flow.

The existing Cursor binary path and API endpoint settings belong to the CLI/ACP integration. Cursor
V2 execution does not launch that binary, and the SDK does not expose an API endpoint override.

## Replay And Live Testing

Cursor replay fixtures preserve the SDK boundary: agent open/resume, sends, ordered `onDelta`
updates, terminal results, cancellation, message snapshots, and close. The real V2 adapter,
orchestrator, event store, projections, and checkpoint logic still run in tests.

Record a fixture against the real SDK with:

```bash
pnpm --filter goat record:cursor-replay --scenario simple
```

Use `--out <path>` to record a temporary probe without replacing a checked-in fixture. Supported
scenarios are listed by the recorder when an invalid scenario is supplied.
