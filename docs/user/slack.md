# Slack

Mention the GOAT bot in a Slack channel or send it a direct message, and GOAT
answers in that Slack thread, starts the work in its own coding thread, and
posts the result back to the same thread. The conversation stays in Slack; the
GOAT Bot screen shows only a chip for the work and its final report.

## Set up

1. Create a Slack app with **Socket Mode** turned on. GOAT opens the
   connection itself, so the app needs no public URL.
2. Give it an app-level token with `connections:write`, and a bot token with
   `chat:write`, `app_mentions:read`, and `im:history`. Subscribe the bot to
   the `app_mention` and `message.im` events, then install the app to your
   workspace.
3. In GOAT, open **Settings → GOAT Bot → Slack** for the machine that
   should do the work. Paste both tokens, list the channel IDs where mentions
   may start work, and turn on **Use Slack**. Tokens stay on that machine and
   are never shown again.
4. Under **Link your Slack account**, create a one-time code and send it to
   the bot in a direct message as `link <code>`. Until you link, the bot only
   explains how to link.

## Good to know

- In a channel, invite the bot and mention it in each message; it does not
  read other channel messages. Direct messages always work.
- Replies, questions, and results go to the thread where you asked, and
  questions tag the person who asked.
- **Default project** decides where work from Slack runs when your message
  doesn't name a project. Without it, GOAT picks the project from the
  conversation and asks only when it can't tell, suggesting the one you worked
  in most recently. **This machine (no project)** runs work that isn't about a
  repository.
- GOAT Bot answers questions about the machine it runs on, such as its name,
  OS, memory, and what is running, without starting work.
- Ask GOAT Bot to remember a standing rule ("always reply in Korean") and it
  follows it from then on, in Slack and in GOAT. It keeps a note only when the
  message you send asks for it, and each note names the message it came from.
  Notes live in
  `goat-bot/memory.md` in GOAT's data folder on that machine; edit the file
  to change them. Put written procedures in `goat-bot/skills/` as Markdown
  files, and the bot points its coding agents to the one that fits. Work sent
  to another machine gets the notes, and any procedure the request names, in
  its first message.
- If a machine running your work goes to sleep or disconnects, GOAT Bot tells
  you. Say "continue on <another host>" to continue from the last copy of its
  work, taken each time the work finishes a turn. New files over 2 MiB and new
  files that look like secrets are not copied. The work on the original machine
  is not deleted.
- When a provider has more than one signed-in account on the machine running
  the work, GOAT uses the one with more quota left and the task card says why,
  such as "Codex (work) · 20% weekly used".
- For memories used in coding conversations and shared between devices, see
  [Memory](./memory.md).
- Work you start from Slack is capped at the access level chosen when you
  created the link code. Its coding agents can use GOAT memory only as far as
  the link allows, and a link you narrow later applies to work that has not
  started yet.
- When you connect to several machines, Slack runs only on the machine GOAT
  Bot lives on. Change it in **Settings → Integrations → GOAT Bot**; set up
  Slack on that machine.

## iMessage (Mac)

GOAT can read direct text messages from allowed iMessage handles on the Mac running its server
and reply in the same conversation. Group chats and attachments are not supported. Give the app
that launches the server **Full Disk Access** to read Messages. macOS asks separately for
**Automation** access when GOAT sends through Messages; Messages must be signed in.

Run `goat imessage enable --allow +15551234567` on that Mac, then
`goat imessage link-code`. From the allowed phone or email, send `link 123456` to the Mac's
Messages account, replacing the example with the printed code. The connection starts with an
approval-required access ceiling; `--full-access` on enable is an explicit opt-in. Restart an
already running server after enabling. `goat imessage status` shows whether the channel is
enabled and whether the local database can be opened without printing handles or message text.
Run `goat imessage disable` to stop it and `goat imessage unlink <handle>` to revoke a linked
sender. An installed server uses its own data directory; pass `--base-dir` when managing a
different local server.
