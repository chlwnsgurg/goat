/**
 * The remote runs the exact release this app is on, from its self-contained
 * archive, so it needs neither Node nor npm. Development can point the remote
 * at a source checkout instead so the two sides can be iterated together.
 *
 * An unpackaged app reports Electron's own version, which names no GOAT
 * release, so it uses the server package version that packaging would stamp.
 *
 * `buildCommitTime` is this build's commit time. It lets the remote order the
 * requested archive against an idle runtime of the same version core, such as an
 * older dev or nightly build, so that runtime is refreshed instead of reused.
