    'Create an ordinary TOP-LEVEL thread with an explicit workspace binding before its agent starts. Use this when the user requests independent work, a new thread, or a PR stack in its own worktree, and for work that owns a goal, runs a loop (HOTL, cxc-loop, repeated PABCD), or spans several cycles, even when the user calls it a subagent: top-level threads appear in the sidebar, where the user can open, steer, and resume them. Use delegate_task for bounded child subagents that report back and end. Set workspaceStrategy to {type:"worktree",baseRef:"parent-branch",branch:"new-branch",startFromOrigin:false} for a new worktree based on local commits, or {type:"existing_worktree",worktreePath:"/absolute/path",branch:"existing-branch"} to use an existing checkout. For upstream commits, set startFromOrigin:true. Omitted workspaceStrategy means the project root, NOT the caller\'s worktree. Omit projectId/modelSelection/modes to inherit those settings from the calling thread; a caller outside a GOAT thread must pass projectId and gets the project\'s default model. Set scratch:true instead of projectId for a thread without a project: it runs in a fresh folder of its own, outside any repository. Put the task in message. Do not ask the agent to create its own worktree via shell: that does not update the thread binding. Each call creates a new launch with no retry key; retain threadId. A calling GOAT thread is woken with a message when the run of the new thread ends or waits on a question, so do not poll it with goat_thread_wait; notifyOnCompletion:false or goat_thread_unwatch stops run-end and host-outage reports. Only local user-input questions still arrive. SSH-host questions then need goat_thread_wait({host}) or goat_pending_request_list({scope:"launched", hosts}). Approvals are no longer reported; check goat_thread_read or tell the user the thread may be waiting. To link a thread for the user, write `[title](' +
    GOAT_THREAD_LINK_PROTOCOL +
    "://v1/<threadId>)` with the threadId exactly as returned, not URL-encoded; GOAT shows the thread's current title. After errors or lost responses, inspect goat_thread_list before retrying. Attachments must be pending uploads. The new thread may not run with broader runtime or interaction modes than the caller: the calling GOAT thread's own modes, or the permission mode an outside agent was approved with. A cloud provider runs without creating a local worktree or running setup. Most cloud providers start from the published source branch and refuse an unavailable or unpublished source with a reason; providers that upload the project folder (such as Claude Cloud) start from its current branch, and local changes may be included. Choose a project repository; scratch is unavailable for cloud tasks. Follow-ups target the same cloud session when its capabilities permit them.",
