/**
 * Wakes a thread when a thread it launched finishes, so orchestrators do not
 * poll. The launcher's server records a watch at launch time and follows each
 * pending run over the connection it already has: this environment's
 * projections, or the SSH-dispatched MCP session of the target's host,
 * authorized as the launcher. A followed run that ends, a question the thread
 * waits on, and a host that stays unreachable each queue one message on the
 * launcher. Watches live in a JSON file under the state directory, so they
 * survive restarts without a database migration.
 *
 * A launch from outside any thread may opt into a launcherless watch. It is
 * followed the same way, at the runtime mode its caller was approved for, but
 * its reports go only to the completion webhook. It belongs to the outside
 * caller that launched (its MCP request namespace), and only that caller sees
 * it in goat_thread_status. Once its run is reported it stays dormant, like a
 * launcher's watch, so a later goat_thread_send from the same caller re-arms
 * it and that run reaches the webhook too.
 *
 * Dormant watches expire: a launcher's after a week without changes, a
 * launcherless one a week after it was last armed. An expired watch is treated
 * as gone, and a periodic sweep drops it and releases any inline secret.
