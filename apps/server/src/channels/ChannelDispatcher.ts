/**
 * ChannelDispatcher - the ledger's central decision maker.
 *
 * A deterministic service, not a hidden agent thread: it reads one task from the ledger, picks a
 * project and launch settings within what the requester may use, records that choice, and starts
 * one coding thread through the normal launch service. When the choice is ambiguous or not
 * allowed it asks the requester instead of guessing. It also forwards answers to worker threads.
 *
 * Launch ids derive from the task and its generation, so a restart re-runs the same launch and
 * lands on the same thread.
