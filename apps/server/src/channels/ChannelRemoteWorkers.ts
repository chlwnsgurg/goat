/**
 * ChannelRemoteWorkers - runs ledger tasks on another machine and brings their reports back.
 *
 * A task whose requester asked for another machine (an SSH alias this machine knows) runs in
 * that machine's own GOAT, in one of its existing projects, through the same SSH launch the
 * goat_ssh_thread_launch tool uses. The launch carries an origin report binding whose id
 * derives from the task and generation. The remote stores that binding before it creates the
 * thread and refuses a second one with the same id, so relaunching a generation after a lost
 * answer can never start a second remote thread.
 *
 * One observer fiber per running remote task long-polls goat_origin_reports_wait. Reports land
 * in a local inbox first (with the cursor, in one write), then each becomes at most one ledger
 * event with an id derived from the report, committed together with its removal from the inbox.
 * While an answer is on its way to the worker every report waits, so a stale question cannot
 * move the task before the answer's run is known. A finished remote run settles the task only
 * after a short second look finds no newer run or report.
 *
 * Remote completion is weaker than local: the remote does not tell us about provider background
 * work or a restart continuation that has not started a run yet.
 *
 * Everything here writes under the channel owner token and stops when it is lost. The remote
 * session's ceiling is the requester's runtime-mode ceiling, so the remote enforces it.
 *
