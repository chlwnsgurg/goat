/**
 * ChannelWorkerReports - turns what worker threads do into ledger task events.
 *
 * Completion comes from the worker thread's own runs, read from its projection: the task's
 * current run must finish `completed`, with no open question, no answer still on its way, no
 * provider background work, no pull request watch, and no pending restart continuation. Process
 * exit, a last assistant sentence, or an explicit "completed" report alone never finish a task.
 * Reading the projection (rather than counting events) makes a replayed or missed event harmless:
 * every pass decides from the current state, and a finished task cannot finish again.
 *
 * Each pass also records what the worker thread shows besides its run status (linked pull
 * requests, native questions and approvals, a usage-limit wait) as `task.worker.observed`. A run
 * that stopped on a usage limit keeps the task alive: GOAT resumes the worker after the reset, or
 * shows that a person has to.
 *
 * Workers may also report progress, questions, and proposed completion with channel_task_report;
 * the caller's thread and generation must match the task's assignment.
 *
 * A running run whose thread has not changed for STALLED_AFTER_MS is recorded stalled. The
 * requester hears about each quiet period once, in the same write as the status. Waiting on a
 * person is not a stall, and the work item itself stays in progress.
