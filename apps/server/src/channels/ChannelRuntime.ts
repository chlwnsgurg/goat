/**
 * ChannelRuntime - runs the channel workers in the one process that owns them.
 *
 * The owner holds the ledger's worker row (refreshed every few seconds) and runs one pass of
 * work whenever a writer signals or a short interval passes: answer new inputs (one at a time
 * per conversation, in arrival order, and up to four conversations at once, each on its own
 * fiber), dispatch received tasks, forward answers, word task updates,
 * bring running tasks in line with their worker threads, and deliver due outbox rows. Run
 * events from worker threads only wake the loop; every pass decides from the ledger and the
 * thread projections, so restarts and missed signals change only timing.
 *
