 * How the agent of one environment reaches a thread attached as context.
 *
 * The thread tools route by SSH alias (`goat_thread_read({ threadId, host })`), and the
 * agent's server resolves that alias with its own SSH config. The only aliases this client
 * knows are the ones on its saved SSH connections, which the desktop app resolved with the
 * SSH config of the machine it runs on. So a saved alias is meaningful to exactly one
 * server: the desktop app's own primary backend, which runs on that machine as the same user.
 * Anything else (a browser, a remote agent, a WSL or T3 Connect environment) has no alias
 * this client can vouch for, and the attachment is refused with the reason.
