# SSH

SSH is how one environment reaches a project on another machine. The local process does not mount
the remote disk. It either runs a remote shell for a browse, or it starts GOAT on that host and
talks to the remote server's own `/mcp`.

The [state roots](settings-and-storage.md#state-roots) contract is what the remote process uses
once it is up: `$HOME/.goat`, not the local default.

## Package

`packages/ssh` (`@goat/ssh`) has no root export. `packages/ssh/package.json` exports `./auth`,
`./command`, `./config`, `./errors`, and `./tunnel`.

`discoverSshHosts` in `packages/ssh/src/config.ts` reads the user's OpenSSH directory: `Host` and
`Include` aliases from `config`, plus hostnames from `known_hosts`. A discovered host is
`DesktopDiscoveredSshHost` in `packages/contracts/src/ipc.ts` (`alias`, `hostname`, `username`,
`port`, `source`). The source is `ssh-config` or `known-hosts`.

`packages/ssh/src/command.ts` builds the `ssh` argv and runs it. `packages/ssh/src/auth.ts` is the
password-prompt and child-environment helper. `packages/ssh/src/errors.ts` is the tagged errors
(`SshCommandError`, `SshLaunchError`, `SshPairingError`, and the rest).
When ssh itself cannot connect (exit 255 with a connect, resolve, or banner timeout), the
`SshCommandError` message names the alias and the address ssh dialled. `prepareRemoteRuntime`
passes SSH errors through unchanged, so an unreachable host never reads as a runtime archive
problem; only an `SshLaunchError` with reason `archive-unavailable` asks for an archive.

## Remote server

`launchOrReuseRemoteServer` and `startSshTunnel` live in `packages/ssh/src/tunnel.ts`. The tunnel
is `ssh -L` onto the remote loopback port. The embedded launch script sets
`DEFAULT_SERVER_HOME="$HOME/.goat"` and unpacks runtimes under
`$HOME/.goat/runtime/goat/versions/`. `SshEnvironmentManager` owns that tunnel's lifetime.
`apps/server/src/sshRemote/SshWorkspaceSync.ts` prints the label `GOAT_HOME` followed by `$HOME`
when it fetches a branch back. That label is not an environment variable `resolveBaseDir` reads.

### Shared runtime

One host user runs one SSH-managed server, and every client shares it. The launch, pairing, MCP
session, stop, and log scripts keep their ownership records (`pid`, `port`, `managed`, `identity`,
`run-t3.sh`, `server.log`) in `~/.goat/ssh-launch/runtime` (`REMOTE_RUNTIME_STATE_KEY` in
`packages/ssh/src/command.ts`), whatever alias, hostname, or port the client dialled. A client that
finds a compatible live server attaches to it, so threads started from any client live in that
server's state and every client sees them.

The runner keeps `run-t3.sh` because independently updated clients and retained supervisors
use that path for reuse, replacement, and rollback. Its shell variables use `GOAT_*`;
only literal `T3_ARCHIVE_VERSION` and `T3_NODE_SCRIPT_PATH` declarations remain as metadata
for older clients that inspect the file without sourcing it. New readers prefer GOAT
declarations and also accept legacy runners.

The live `~/.goat/userdata/server-runtime.json` record and the server's descriptor decide identity.
Remembered launch files whose PID has exited are stale and do not block attaching
(`readLiveSshRuntimeProtocol` in `apps/server/src/cli/sshHelper.ts`). They never grant kill
authority either, because the launch script requires its PID file to name the live PID.

Desktop and agent dispatch both leave the server running when they disconnect
(`leaveRemoteServerRunning`). The explicit stop script signals a server only after its
`/.well-known/goat/activity` (with a 404 fallback to `/.well-known/t3/activity`) answers `idle` for that PID. `busy` or no answer leaves it running.
No client signals a server to replace it; see [Replacement](#replacement).

Protocol ranges decide compatibility. The descriptor advertises `protocol: {ssh, orchestration}`
as `{min, max}` ranges, and a client attaches when both overlap its own.
`compareRuntimeProtocols` in `packages/shared/src/sshRuntimeProtocol.ts` is the one comparator.
It answers `compatible`, `update-required`, `client-too-old` or `unknown`. The TypeScript
client and the launch script both use it, the script through `__ssh-helper compat` in
`apps/server/src/cli/sshHelper.ts`. A server that advertises only the two integers is a point
range. Only a server with neither (`unknown`) falls back to matching the exact release.
`serverVersion` is informational.

### Replacement

A server is replaced only through its own drain. The descriptor of a server that can drain carries
`capabilities.drainRestart` and an `instanceId`, which is new for every start. A server without
them is attach-only: no client replaces or signals it. If such a server is compatible, the
client attaches. If it is incompatible, the launch fails and asks the user to stop it.

The launch script holds the host replacement lock and calls `__ssh-helper drain`. That helper
sends `POST /.well-known/goat/runtime/drain` with `expectedInstanceId` and the target version. The
server accepts it only from loopback, with the secret from `<userdata>/runtime-control.token`
(mode `0600`, new every start). A request that names another start gets `instance-changed`.

While it drains, `RuntimeAdmission` (`apps/server/src/runtimeAdmission.ts`) makes
`Orchestrator.dispatch` refuse new work with `ServerDrainingError`. That covers clients, MCP,
scheduled tasks and channels alike. Continuations, steering into running work, and interrupts
still pass.

Every client that subscribed to the lifecycle stream with `runtimeDrain: true` receives
`runtimeDrain` events. Older clients never opt in, so they never have to decode the event.

`RuntimeDrain` (`apps/server/src/runtimeDrain.ts`) waits until no admitted dispatch is in flight
and projections report `idle`, or until the grace window ends. The window is 60 s by default and
at most 300 s. What happens next depends on the user's confirmation:

- Unconfirmed, an expired window cancels the drain, and the server admits turns again. The client
  reports a `busy` pending replacement and retries later.
- With `confirmReplacement` (the request's `force`), the drain completes at the deadline.
- On completion the server answers `drained` and sends itself `SIGTERM`. Normal shutdown
  persists restart continuations, and the successor's startup recovery restores those threads.

An automatic refresh of an older compatible runtime drains only a server that answered `idle`, so
its retries never hold up new turns. An incompatible runtime, which the client cannot use at all,
drains for the full window.

After `drained`, the script runs `__ssh-helper supervise` under `nohup` so a dropped SSH
session cannot strand the host. The supervisor:

1. Waits for the old PID to exit, then backs up `statev2.sqlite` while it holds the userdata's
   `server-owner.lock`. If another server holds that lock, it starts nothing and fails.
2. Starts the new runner on the same port and requires a handshake: a descriptor with the target
   version, a new `instanceId`, and compatible ranges. The runner gets `GOAT_SSH_REPLACEMENT_ID`,
   so the new server records itself in the lock's owner log as this replacement.
3. On failure, stops only the child it started and restores the database and the previous
   `run-t3.sh`. Then it starts the previous version (rollback). The database is restored only
   when the owner log since the backup names nobody but the supervisor and its replacement, so
   another server's writes are never overwritten.

After a rollback to a compatible version, the client attaches to it.

### Upgrades

A client that launches a host owns its runtime and moves it to its own release. The packaged
desktop and the server's SSH dispatch (`resolveSshCliRunner` in
`apps/server/src/sshRemote/SshRemoteDispatch.ts`) both set `refreshOwnedRuntimeOnFirstConnection`.

- With no server running, the client installs and starts its release, even when `run-t3.sh` names
  an older compatible release that is still installed. It keeps the retained release only when that
  one is newer, or when its own archive cannot be acquired. `ssh.runtime.upgrade.skipped` logs why.
- With an older compatible server running, the first connection of each manager drains it once it
  answers `idle` (see [Replacement](#replacement)). While it is busy, the client attaches to it,
  logs `ssh.runtime.refresh.deferred` with the reason, and retries every 10 minutes.

"Older" and "newer" come from `compareRuntimeBuilds` in `packages/shared/src/semver.ts`, used by
both the client and the remote `__ssh-helper compare-version`. A different core version, or two
numbered builds of one train (`0.1.0-nightly.20261012.2`), order by SemVer. Any other pair of one
core, such as two `0.1.0-dev.<sha>` builds or a dev build against a nightly, orders by the commit
time each server build embeds (`apps/server/vite.config.ts` reads it from git, or from
`GOAT_BUILD_COMMIT_TIME`). The probe reads the installed builds' times with
`__ssh-helper commit-time`, and the client sends its own as `archiveCommitTime`. When either time
is missing, the pair has no order: a running server is kept (`ssh.runtime.upgrade.skipped` logs
why), and an incompatible one is refused and left running. There are two exceptions. On a stopped
host, a retained build with no commit time predates stamping, so a stamped client installs its own
release over it. Stopping a server from before commit stamps once therefore moves its host to the
client's build. And a build of unknown order whose CLI cannot issue memory scopes (the shell's
`lacks_memory_scopes` reads `auth session issue --help`) counts as older, with pending replacement
`capability`, because keeping it would fail every memory-granted task on that host. A newer build
is never replaced for this. The MCP-session script never drops requested memory scopes: a CLI that
cannot issue them makes it print `GOAT_SESSION_ERROR=memory_scopes_unsupported runtime=<version>`,
which the client reports as an `SshPairingError` naming the runtime.

Only the pairing and MCP-session helpers pass `keepExistingRunner`. It never installs, refreshes,
or replaces a runtime.

An archive upload pipes the bytes into ssh's stdin. If the remote reader exits early, only that
upload fails, as an `SshLaunchError` carrying the remote's stderr and exit code. A lost connection
or a timeout stays the `SshCommandError` that names the host. The patched
`@effect/platform-node-shared` spawner keeps an `error` listener on every child stdin, so a write
still queued when ssh exits cannot crash the process with `EPIPE`.

### Connect and disconnect order

`SshEnvironmentManager` orders `ensureEnvironment` and `disconnectEnvironment` calls for one
target by arrival. Both resolve the alias before they take the target lock, so a later call can
reach the lock first. A disconnect does nothing once a newer call for that target exists, and an
ensure fails as cancelled once a newer disconnect exists.

The client registry keeps one SSH teardown per route in flight (`forkSshDisconnect` in
`packages/client-runtime/src/connection/registry.ts`). Switching off again while it is stalled
marks it to run once more, and that rerun happens only if the route is still off when the first
one returns.

The desktop app is a second caller of the same package. `apps/desktop/src/ssh/DesktopSshEnvironment.ts`
discovers hosts and ensures an environment. The server-side caller used by agents is
`apps/server/src/sshRemote/SshRemoteDispatch.ts`, which imports `@goat/ssh/command`,
`@goat/ssh/auth`, `@goat/ssh/config`, `@goat/ssh/errors`, and `@goat/ssh/tunnel`.
`apps/server/src/device/SshDeviceHost.ts` uses `@goat/ssh/command` for device commands.

## Agent dispatch

`apps/server/src/mcp/toolkits/ssh/tools.ts` registers `goat_ssh_host_list`, `goat_ssh_browse`,
`goat_ssh_thread_launch`, and `goat_ssh_reports`. Browse uses `apps/server/src/sshRemote/remoteBrowse.ts`.
Launch goes through `SshRemoteDispatch.launchThread`. When the MCP caller is itself a thread, the
SSH toolkit asks `RemoteDispatchCoordinator` to persist the dispatch first. That coordinator is
[`launch-and-remote-dispatch.md`](launch-and-remote-dispatch.md).

Workspace sync for a remote checkout is `apps/server/src/sshRemote/SshWorkspaceSync.ts`. Remote
repo paths it prints sit under `$HOME/.goat/repos/`.
