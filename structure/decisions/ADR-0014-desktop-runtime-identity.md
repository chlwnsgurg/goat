# ADR-0014 — decision recorded under "Runtime identity"

- Contract owner: [desktop.md](../desktop.md#runtime-identity)
- Issue: goat-si/goat#110

## Decision record

- **Purpose.** Run the desktop app as Electron runtime `GOAT <stage>` on `goat://app` instead of
  `T3 Code <stage>` on `t3code://app`, without losing saved secrets or renderer storage and with a
  working rollback.
- **Before.** Electron names the safeStorage key (macOS Keychain item, Linux Secret Service entry)
  from `app.name` as it stands before the event loop starts. `app.setName("T3 Code <stage>")` ran
  after asynchronous startup work, so in practice the key sat under the initial package name. The
  renderer scheme keyed localStorage and IndexedDB. The profile directory was already GOAT's own
  (`goat-desktop*`) and depends on neither.
- **Alternatives.**
  - Re-encrypt each safeStorage blob through a helper process running under the old name. It only
    covers blobs GOAT knows about (not Clerk's token store), and rewriting the files breaks a
    rolled-back build.
  - Copy the Chromium LevelDB and IndexedDB directories to the new origin. Chromium keys its storage
    buckets internally; a file copy is not a supported format.
- **Decision.**
  - Set `GOAT <stage>` synchronously when `main.ts` loads. Before Electron first uses safeStorage,
    copy the key of the initial package name (or `T3 Code <stage>`) to the new name. All ciphertext
    stays valid for both names. Windows needs nothing: its key sits in the profile, protected by DPAPI.
  - Before the first window, a detached page on each origin exports and imports localStorage and
    every IndexedDB database, never replacing data the new origin holds.
  - Register both schemes with the OS and accept both in link parsers and the server CORS list.
- **Reasons.** Copying the key moves every safeStorage consumer at once and leaves nothing to undo.
  Reading storage through the page uses Chromium's own formats.
- **Tradeoffs.**
  - The KWallet backend on Linux is not covered; its secrets need re-entry.
  - If the copy fails and Electron then creates a fresh key, the next launch logs a conflict and
    keeps both keys; secrets written under the old one need re-entry.
  - The origin copy retries once in the same launch, then lets the window open. After that the app
    creates its own data, which a later import never replaces.
  - A rolled-back build sees data as of the migration, not what the new build wrote afterwards.
  - A desktop from this change needs servers that accept the `goat://app` origin, and a Clerk
    instance that allows the `goat://app/` redirect.

## Frozen legacy identities

Decided 2026-10-20 in #110, #111 and #112. The names below keep their T3 spelling through the
first stable release. Renaming one is a migration of installed state. It is revisited only together
with a migration that has been verified on real installs, and the rename tooling keeps each one
(`scripts/lib/goat-rename/rules.ts`).

- **Linux desktop entry `t3code.desktop`, `StartupWMClass` `t3code`, and the deb package
  `t3code`.** Docks match windows to pinned launchers, URL handlers and file associations through
  the entry name and WM class, so a rename orphans what users set up. A renamed deb package installs
  next to the old one instead of upgrading it. Nothing users see gets better.
- **Preview browser partitions (`persist:t3code-preview-*`).** Each partition holds the cookies
  and logins of a preview tab. Electron has no supported way to copy a partition, so a rename signs
  every user out of every previewed site.
- **GNOME capture extension uuid `snap-shot@t3.codes`, its D-Bus names
  (`com.t3tools.T3Code.SnapShot`, `/com/t3tools/SnapShot`), and the KDE helper
  `com.t3tools.T3Code.KdeCapture`.** On Wayland, GNOME Shell loads a newly installed extension
  only after the user signs out and back in, so a renamed extension switches capture off for every
  existing user until then. A later rename must keep the old extension working until the new one
  is active.
- **Mobile native names**: the `t3-*` Expo modules in `apps/mobile/modules/`, the `T3*` native
  views and classes, the Android notification tags, and the `t3-agent-notifications`
  SharedPreferences store. None is visible to users. Renaming a module changes the native
  fingerprint and needs a new store build. Renaming the tags or the store orphans notifications
  that are already posted and loses saved preferences. The upstream modules, such as
  `t3-source-text`, would also make every upstream sync conflict. The notification channel ids
  are already `agent-alerts` and `agent-activity`, so per-channel settings are not affected.
  Revisit these only when a native rebuild happens for another reason. That rebuild must migrate
  the tags and the store, match notifications still posted under the legacy tags, and be checked
  on Android and iOS devices.
- **SSH runner `run-t3.sh`.** Clients of every version find and reuse the runner on a remote host
  by this name, so an older client would no longer see the runner a newer one installed.
