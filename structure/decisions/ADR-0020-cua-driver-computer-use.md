# ADR-0020 — decision recorded under "Computer use"

- Contract owner: [server.md](../server.md#computer-use)
- Commit: `ba39b38a3` in #665 (pin, telemetry opt-outs, identity), on top of the ports of
  pingdotgg/t3code#21694 at `b8569ac92` and #21695 at `dc307c8a7`. The commit messages do not
  record the alternatives below; they come from the lane plan and research for this program.

## Decision record

- **Purpose.** Agents in GOAT should be able to see and operate the GOAT host's desktop (computer
  use) on macOS, Windows and Linux, with a driver GOAT can ship under its own license terms, keep
  pinned, and keep from reporting usage to a third party.
- **Before.**
  - GOAT had no computer use. Agents could drive the collaborative browser preview only.
  - Upstream T3 Code had two open, unmerged Cua Driver stacks. The newer one (#21694-#21697, by
    Julius Marminge, rebuilt from his #16527) adds verified distribution, an opt-in server
    lifecycle, an Electron-owned host and packaging, and attaches nothing to agents. It pins Cua
    Driver 0.34.1.
  - The Cua Driver SDK and executable speak a private protocol and must share a version.
    `@trycua/cua-driver` on npm stops at 0.37.0; driver 0.38.0 exists only as a GitHub release.
- **Alternatives.**
  - The Cua SDK (`@trycua/cua`) or Cua Spaces. They target sandboxes and VMs, are several hundred
    MB per platform, and Spaces (`cua-spacesd`) is FSL licensed.
  - A provider's built-in computer use (for example a Codex `cua_repl` tool). It exists for one
    provider only and runs under that provider's identity, not GOAT's.
  - Writing a GOAT host for each OS. It repeats the accessibility, capture and input work the MIT
    driver already does on three platforms.
  - Waiting for upstream to merge. GOAT would carry nothing until then and the eventual chase would
    land the same files anyway.
- **Decision.**
  - **Port upstream.** GOAT carries the upstream stack at its frozen heads with GOAT renames
    (`scripts/goat-rename.ts`), and reconciles file by file when upstream merges its version
    (fork delta area `cua-driver`).
  - **Pin 0.37.0.** `packages/shared/src/cuaDriverRelease.ts` pins the official 0.37.0 archive
    names, byte sizes and SHA-256 from the release's `SHA256SUMS`, and the pnpm catalog pins
    `@trycua/cua-driver` 0.37.0, the newest version published for both halves. Updates happen only
    through GOAT releases. The driver's own update check and `update --apply` are never used.
  - **MIT parts only.** GOAT ships the `cua-driver` executable and the `@trycua/cua-driver` SDK
    (MIT; the SDK's native packages add an MPL-2.0 Node runtime with its notice). Never the Cua
    SDK, Spaces, perception or set-of-marks components (FSL or AGPL), extensions or skill packs.
  - **Telemetry and update check off.** The driver sends usage events by default. The embedded
    host clears the daemon's environment and rejects names outside its allowlist, so every host
    passes `CUA_DRIVER_RS_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false`, `CUA_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false` and
    `CUA_DRIVER_RS_UPDATE_CHECK=false` (`cuaDriverHostOptions`). `DO_NOT_TRACK` and
    `CUA_TELEMETRY` are not on that allowlist and passing them makes host construction fail. The
    MCP descriptor agents spawn (`cua-driver mcp`) is a separate process outside the allowlist,
    so the server adds all five opt-outs to it (`withCuaDriverPrivacyEnvironment`).
  - **Off by default.** The server setting `enableCua` starts false. Standalone servers
    honor `GOAT_CUA_DRIVER_PATH` before downloading. Desktop servers ask the Electron main
    process for a host over the private control pipe; the Electron host itself is ported
    separately (#21696, #21697 on feat/cua-driver-desktop).
  - **Identity.** The standalone host identifies as `si.goat.server`. The Electron host is to
    use the app's `appUserModelId` (`si.goat.desktop` and its nightly and dev variants).
  - Pending in later records: which providers get the driver as an MCP server, the permission
    mode and capability ceiling (including removal of the driver's on-demand
    `check_for_update` tool), approval for unattended threads, and enabling it on remote hosts.
- **Reasons.**
  - Upstream's design already went through six adversarial review rounds. Carrying it unchanged
    keeps the chase small and the review history meaningful.
  - 0.37.0 is the only version where the SDK and the executable can match from public sources.
  - The embedded allowlist is enforced in the driver (`allowed_environment_name` in
    `cua-driver-sdk/src/embedded.rs` at `cua-driver-rs-v0.37.0`); naming only allowed switches is
    the one way an opt-out reaches the daemon.
- **Tradeoffs.**
  - This combined port and 0.37.0 pin is a new integration that upstream has not reviewed.
  - Standalone servers download about 37-53 MB on first enable. Once desktop packaging lands,
    packaged desktop builds carry the driver whether or not the user enables it.
  - Native macOS TCC attribution, Windows hosting and packaged Linux capture still need human
    qualification, as upstream's PRs state.
