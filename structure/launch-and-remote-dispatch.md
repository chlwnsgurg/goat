# Launch watches and remote dispatch

Two mechanisms tell a launcher thread what happened to work it started somewhere else. A launch
watch follows runs. A remote dispatch is the durable row for work that was sent to another host,
plus the reports that host sends back. Both end in a [command commit](server.md#command-commit)
on the launcher's server when they have something to say. Neither one runs the provider itself.

## Launch watches

A launch watch is a launcher thread's request to hear about another thread. The module comment on
`apps/server/src/mcp/launchWatch.ts` defines that, and keeps the wake messages free of I/O.
`LaunchWatchService` in `apps/server/src/mcp/LaunchWatchService.ts` stores the watches and follows
them.

The file is `thread-launch-watches.json` (`LAUNCH_WATCH_FILE`) under the server state directory.
There is no migration. `register`, `rearm`, `unwatch`, and `list` are the service methods.

`goat_thread_launch` (`apps/server/src/mcp/toolkits/project/handlers.ts`) and
`goat_ssh_thread_launch` (`apps/server/src/mcp/toolkits/ssh/handlers.ts`) register a watch when
`notifyOnCompletion` is not false. `HostThreadsMcpService` in
`apps/server/src/mcp/HostThreadsMcpService.ts` re-arms a watch after `goat_thread_send`. A send
from another thread joins the target's turn the way [`mcp-toolkits.md`](mcp-toolkits.md) describes.
The re-arm follows the run that send started or joined. It does not change that delivery.

The follower reads local projections, or long-polls through `SshRemoteDispatch` when the thread is
remote. `deliver` dispatches `message.dispatch` onto `watch.launcherThreadId`. A finished run, a
question the thread is waiting on, and a host that stays unreachable each produce one wake.

## Remote dispatch

`RemoteDispatchCoordinator` in `apps/server/src/remoteReports/RemoteDispatchCoordinator.ts` inserts
a row in `remote_dispatches` and then calls `SshRemoteDispatch.launchThread`. Migration
`apps/server/src/persistence/Migrations/064_RemoteDispatches.ts` creates that table. Reports use
`apps/server/src/persistence/Migrations/063_RemoteReports.ts` and `RemoteReportService`.
`apps/server/src/persistence/Migrations/066_RemoteDispatchQuestions.ts` adds
`pending_request_ids`, a JSON array of the launched run's open question ids. The coordinator
writes that column from the host's observed `pendingRequestIds` before it announces questions.
When delivery is `wake` and the remote thread id is set, it dispatches one notice per question
onto the origin thread. The same ids are `pendingRequestIds` on `RemoteDispatchView` in
`packages/contracts/src/remoteReports.ts`. A finished run stores an empty list.

Two callers launch this way:

- `goat_ssh_thread_launch`, when the MCP caller has a thread scope, calls `coordinator.launch`
  with `kind: "thread"`. Without a thread scope it calls `SshRemoteDispatch.launchThread` directly.
- `delegate_task` with `target.host` and a remote cwd calls `coordinator.launch` with
  `kind: "task"` from `apps/server/src/mcp/OrchestratorMcpService.ts`.

The remote agent reports with `goat_origin_report` (`apps/server/src/mcp/toolkits/remoteReport/tools.ts`).
The origin reads those reports over the SSH session it already holds. The public view is
`RemoteDispatchView` in `packages/contracts/src/remoteReports.ts`.

Delivery mode decides who wakes. Launch-watch wakes and origin reports are different messages.
A watch fires when a followed run ends. A report is the remote thread speaking back through the
origin binding.
