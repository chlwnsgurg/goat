# Scheduled tasks

A scheduled task is a server-owned prompt that fires on a clock or on a webhook, then enters
orchestration through the same launch and send services a person uses. The transport that creates
the task does not launch the thread itself.

Rows live in `scheduled_tasks`. Webhook deliveries live beside them. Both are written by
`ScheduledTaskService` in `apps/server/src/scheduledTasks/ScheduledTaskService.ts`. Schedule
arithmetic (`nextScheduledRunAt`, `isSameSchedule`, `isMissedFixedTimeRun`) is
`apps/server/src/scheduledTasks/Schedule.ts`.

## Clock

`Scheduler.register` in `apps/server/src/scheduling/Scheduler.ts` forks each source on a loop that
sleeps 5 seconds. The scheduled-task source is registered as `"scheduled-tasks"` and calls
`runDueTasks`. One source does not overlap itself.

`runTask` marks the row running, then:

- if the task has no bound thread, `ThreadLaunchService.launch` starts one;
- if it has a bound thread, `ThreadManagementService.sendToThread` queues the prompt.

Both calls become a [command commit](server.md#command-commit). The command id is derived from the
task id and the fire key, so the same webhook delivery does not dispatch twice.

## Webhook

`apps/server/src/scheduledTasks/webhookRoute.ts` is the HTTP entry. Verification lives in
`apps/server/src/scheduledTasks/webhookVerification.ts`. A queued webhook run uses the same
`runTask` path. The prompt for that delivery is rendered when the request arrives.

The MCP tool `schedule_task` in `apps/server/src/mcp/toolkits/orchestrator/tools.ts` builds an
upsert and calls `ScheduledTaskService.upsert` from `apps/server/src/mcp/OrchestratorMcpService.ts`.
The WebSocket methods in `apps/server/src/ws.ts` call `list`, `upsert`, and `setEnabled` on that
same service.
