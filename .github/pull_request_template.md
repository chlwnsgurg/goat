<!--
Read CONTRIBUTING.md before opening a PR. Review capacity is limited, and meeting
the requirements does not guarantee review or merging. Solve one underlying problem.
The same requirements apply to drafts. Draft status does not defer triage or closure.
Use a conventional commit title in plain language, such as "fix(web): new threads no longer spike CPU".
-->

## Problem

<!-- Explain the problem in a sentence or two. Include expected behavior and
reproduction steps or environment where relevant. -->

## Change

<!-- Explain how this fixes the problem. If it spans components or clients,
explain why those changes are needed for the same fix. Split independent fixes. -->

## Scope and approval

<!-- Link the triaged bug issue or the discussion with explicit maintainer approval
of direction and scope, including the approval comment. For a very small, focused
fix of an obvious bug, explain why it qualifies without a prior issue or discussion.
For focused configuration of an established capability, explain what already exists,
what the option controls, and why its effects stay within that capability. Adding a
setting alone is not a new feature or an approval exemption; broader workflow or
behavior changes still need approval. Scope and verification requirements still apply.
There is no line-count or file-count cutoff. -->

## Verification

<!-- Describe the focused tests or manual checks you ran and the observed results
for the changed behavior. State anything you could not check. "Tests pass" alone
is insufficient; broad repo-wide checks are not required. -->

## Screenshots

<!-- Required when the PR changes apps/web, apps/desktop, apps/mobile, or apps/marketing.
Embed clear before/after images here; the goat-screenshot-gate check looks for an embedded
image. Include a short recording when motion, timing, or interaction details matter.

Drag images into this editor, or run `node scripts/pr-assets.ts upload <pr> <files...> --patch-body`,
which uploads them to the orphan pr-assets branch and links them by commit SHA:
![after](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goat-si/goat/<sha>/<pr>/<name>.png)
Relative paths such as pr-assets/after.png and branch-name links do not render.
Never commit screenshots to the PR branch. Delete this section for non-UI changes. -->

<!-- If you used an agent, end with the model and harness that did the work. -->
